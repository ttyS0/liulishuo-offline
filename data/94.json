It took 54 years before the judges recognised music beyond the European classical tradition,  making Wynton Marsalis's Blood on the Fields the first jazz winner. There have only been two jazz winners since then and nothing from the world of popular song. The prize has long been criticised as stuffy and irrelevant.","frames":[600,38280],"images":[]},{"text":"However,  the Pulitzer board startled a lot of people this year as Kendrick Lamar became the first rapper to win the Pulitzer Prize for his album Damn and was also the first music winner in the 100-year history of the Pulitzers to come from outside of the world of classical or jazz.","frames":[39340,57820],"images":[]},{"text":"Judges said the album shows Lamar is an expert in music,  rhythm and storytelling. His music has been praised for combining hip-hop,  poetry,  jazz,  soul,  funk,  and African sounds. Most of his works discuss issues such as blackness,  street life,  survival,  and self-worth. His lyrics contain multitudes and his technical brilliance is never self-regarding virtuosity but a means to an end: more clarity,  more complexity,  more honesty.","frames":[58800,92100],"images":[]},{"text":"The Pulitzer Prize – and other awards – show Lamar has earned the respect of both the public and critics. He is currently enjoying a streak of commercial and critical success comparable to Stevie Wonder's in the 1970s. The Associated Press says he has become the \"voice of the generation.\"","frames":[93120,112800],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1525433254910-284.png","id":94}
