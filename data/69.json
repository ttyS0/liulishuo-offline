That's Mastodon,  a Twitter-like social network that has had a massive spike in sign-ups this week. As the #DeleteFacebook movement has gained steam,  people are registering for Mastodon at four times the rate that they normally do,  according to the service's creator.","frames":[22820,45000],"images":[]},{"text":"Between Monday and Tuesday alone,  Mastodon gained about 5, 800 new users,  the creator said in an interview. That's more new registrations than what Mastodon typically sees over an entire week.","frames":[45800,60960],"images":[]},{"text":"For a social network — Mastodon has 1.1 million users to Facebook's 2.2 billion — that may not sound very impressive. But what makes Mastodon increasingly attractive,  particularly in a post-#DeleteFacebook world,  is its attitude toward data and control. Mastodon's code is open-source,  meaning anybody can inspect its design. It's distributed,  meaning that it doesn't run in some data center controlled by corporate executives but instead is run by its own users who set up independent servers. And its development costs are paid for by online donations,  rather than through the marketing of users' personal information.","frames":[61540,107400],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1523272827095-21.png","id":69}
