{"title":"The strange birth, death and rebirth of a Russian troll account called 'AllForUSA'","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1534926053405-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1534926053405-4.jpg","contents":["An Indiana man named Jesse D. Allen created a website in 2005 with the title AllForUSA.com,  apparently to pursue some business interests,  but he soon abandoned the site.","A decade later,  at the age of 80,  Allen died.","But AllForUSA was just getting started.","As the 2016 presidential campaign heated up,  AllForUSA.com suddenly bristled with what appeared to be news articles celebrating Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and bashing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.","“HILLARY May END UP in PRISON AFTER ALL, ” read one headline.","On Reddit,  the commenter “allforusa” posted similar messages and linked to headlines on AllForUSA.com.","The following year,  after Trump’s election,  a Twitter account named “@allforusa11” retweeted the president before inexplicably changing subjects to tweet about feminism—in Japanese.","The final twist came a few months later when AllForUSA.com was reborn again—this time as a Russian online gambling site.","A clue to the mystery of this multilingual burst of activity appeared in a February indictment by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.","It said the Russians who operated fake social media accounts to manipulate American voters used allforusa@yahoo.com to fraudulently access a PayPal account and to promote a “March for Trump” campaign rally in New York.","The other “AllForUSA” accounts probably were operated in tandem with this email address and with each other,  according to a report Monday from cyberintelligence firm GroupSense,  whose researchers found a subtle tangle of connections left in records discovered online.","The report highlights how data breaches fuel nefarious online activity,  giving criminal hackers and disinformation teams an endless supply of cheap accounts to use individually or for networks of “bots, ” automated accounts controlled by a single operative.","All this typically takes place without the original owners knowing what happened to their creations."]}
