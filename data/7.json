Or losing was winning. Trump  would be the most famous man in the world—a martyr to crooked Hillary Clinton. Melania Trump could return to inconspicuously lunching.","That was the trouble-free outcome they awaited on November 8,  2016. Losing would work out for everybody.","Shortly after eight o'clock that evening,  when the unexpected trend--Trump might actually win--seemed confirmed,  Don Jr. told a friend that his father,  or DJT,  as he called him,  looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania,  to whom Donald Trump had made his solemn guarantee,  was in tears--and not of joy.","There was,  in the space of little more than an hour,  in Steve Bannon's not unamused observation,  a befuddled Trump morphing into a disbelieving Trump and then into a quite horrified Trump. But still to come was the final transformation: suddenly,  Donald Trump became a man who believed that he deserved to be and was wholly capable of being the president of the United States."]}
