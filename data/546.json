You can’t shake her from something she believes in by arguing it may not serve her best interests,  because she will always come back at you with the simple question: “But is it the right thing to do?”"},{"frames":[31440,67280],"images":[],"text":"Foreign trips with the prime minister are brutal. You cross time zones and pack endless diplomatic meetings into the schedule. For her aides,  the flight home is an opportunity to relax. But I remember looking up on one such flight after a particularly hectic trip and seeing her quietly and diligently working through the papers in her red box. I felt I had to try and keep going even though I was exhausted. The prime minister,  though,  won’t rest until every bit of work is done."},{"frames":[67280,100000],"images":[],"text":"This is the side of May the public doesn’t see. Many have said recently they don’t know how she keeps going. But for everything we see in public,  there is just as much going on behind the scenes. The security briefings,  the policy meetings,  the commitments to charities that she would do everything in her power to meet. Woe betide anyone who suggested an appearance should be cancelled and she would have to let a particular charity down. Duty is everything,  after all."},{"frames":[100000,102000],"images":[],"text":""}]}
