{"title":"Ikea has changed the way we think about furniture","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/1517913818147-rc-upload-1517913658733-12.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1517913799821-rc-upload-1517913658733-4.png","contents":["Ingvar Kamprad,  founder of the Swedish furniture giant Ikea,  died Jan. 27 in Sweden at age 91. Since its founding in 1943,  the company has transformed the way we shop for furniture,  how we put it together and how it looks.","Traditional furniture stores may line up all of their sofas in one section and beds in another,  but Ikea displays items by room,  so shoppers can see how different pieces might look together.","Ikea also gave rise to the revolutionary idea of flat-pack furniture. Distributing flat-pack was much more efficient than shipping fully made items. And prices were lower because the customer had to assemble the product.","With its sleek lines and practical pieces,  Ikea has outfitted millions of apartments and brought its own style into everyday homes."]}
