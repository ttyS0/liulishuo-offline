Classrooms in 16, 769 schools,  including schools for Japanese children living overseas,  were given a vote each for casting ballots.","The Olympic mascots resemble science-fiction superheroes. One is dark blue and white,  in futuristic garb,  decorated with a traditional checkered pattern dating back to the Edo era. The pink Paralympics mascot makes use of the traditional cherry blossom motif.","Tokyo's overall budget for the Olympics has been spiraling. It was roughly $12.6 billion in mid-February. However,  Tokyo has only brought in around $3 billion in sponsorship so far,  according to an announcement by the International Olympic Committee in early February.  In a country that loves cute things,  perhaps the mascots will bring in millions of dollars worth of additional revenue in sponsorship and franchising."]}
