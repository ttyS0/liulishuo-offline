So far,  so typical for the studio behemoth,  which rarely misses a marketing trick. But this time there’s a twist,  because the live-action Mulan has a surprising advantage over the rest of Disney’s live-action remakes: It looks good.","frames":[5200,32960]},{"images":[],"text":"First of all,  this is a spectacularly well-made trailer. The opening is not that different from most trailers. But after that first fade to black,  we get something that probably won’t be in the theatrical version of Mulan: a montage.","frames":[32960,49200]},{"images":[],"text":"The gradually-accelerating action sequence montage is a trailer cliché,  but this is executed flawlessly,  down to the little “It is my duty to fight” epilogue slowing the pace as efficiently as a brake run on Space Mountain to give the audience time to catch its breath before the title. It’s a spectacular trailer for what looks like it might be a good movie.","frames":[49200,73920]},{"images":[],"text":"Mulan is a story with set pieces that are better suited to live-action than animation,  and a heroine whose feats are more impressive if we see an actual human body performing them,  whatever wires or special effects are involved behind the scenes. This feels less like Disney’s other cash grabs and more like a story finally landing in the appropriate medium.","frames":[73920,98400]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1562662976383-2.png","author":"190710 Wed.
