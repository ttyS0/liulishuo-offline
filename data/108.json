The team had not attempted either because it was uncharted territory ethically.","However,  Nottingham Trent ethics and philosophy lecturer Benjamin Curtis said it could lead to humans enduring a \"living hell\".","\"Even if your conscious brain were kept alive after your body had died,  you would have to spend the foreseeable future as a disembodied brain without access to the sense that allows us to experience and interact with the world, \" he told The Conversation. \"In the best-case scenario you would be spending your life with only your own thoughts for company.","\"Some have argued that even with a fully functional body,  immortality would be tedious. To end up a disembodied human brain may well be to suffer a fate worse than death.\""]}
