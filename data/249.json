Kors is not alone in its calculated buying spree — and is competing with other deep-pocketed suitors such as the company formerly known as Coach — now called Tapestry — which has bought brands including Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman.","Kors’ aim,  in part,  is to transcend the “middle market” of the luxury sector. Michael Kors has traditionally been reliant on outlets and department stores,  where deep discounting is common. Leather purses sell for as little as $70 and handbags are available for $95.","Versace,  controlled by its namesake family since the 1997 murder of founder Gianni Versace,  offers Kors an intriguing skein of possibilities. The Milan-based brand is known for its Medusa-head logo,  glamorous gowns and bold printed pieces that sell for thousands of dollars."]}
