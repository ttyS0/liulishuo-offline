She explained that her dog Bam Bam \"looked a little bit,  a little bit crazy and then she was you know,  licking her mouth â€¦ and running around.\"","As it turns out Bam Bam and other dogs in the area have been getting high from licking cane toads.","The cane toad,  perhaps one of Queensland's most annoying pests,  has infested the tropical regions of Australia. Cane toads protect themselves by secreting a toxin from the glands on their back. When ingested,  it can make the subject quite high.","\"Generally,  we're presented with dogs that are salivating profusely,  they're quite hyper-excited and they often can be tremoring ... worst cases they're seizuring or they can even go into cardiac arrest, \" said Brisbane vet Dr. Kirsty Fridemanis. \"Dogs are curious,  they want to put things in their mouth to have a bit of an idea of the smell and the taste and then find out what it is.\"","Unfortunately,  due to the sheer amount of cane toads in Queensland and how difficult it is to remove them,  the only sure prevention method is keeping dogs under strict surveillance."]}
