So you make an effort to look busy."},{"frames":[37840,49680],"images":[],"text":"Some of this may be a self-perpetuating cycle.

Rather than work hard,  you toil to make bosses think that you are. Leaving a jacket on your office chair,  walking around purposefully with a notebook or clipboard and sending out emails at odd hours are three of the best known tricks. After a while this can result in collective self-delusion that this pretence is actual work."},{"frames":[72560,88080],"images":[],"text":"But presenteeism has more serious consequences. It is perhaps most prevalent in Japan,  where people attend the office even when they are in discomfort.
