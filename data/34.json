Herbal remedies with loquat have been produced in China for hundreds of years. \"All of a sudden,  everybody is talking about it, \" said Ching Weh Chen,  owner of Pearl River,  a Chinese market in New York City.","Taking herbal supplements can involve health risks,  including when they are used with medicines,  consumed in excess or taken instead of prescription medication. The Food and Drug Administration advises consumers to speak to a health-care provider before taking a supplement and to be wary of any product claims that sound too good to be true."]}
