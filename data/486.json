The share of adults aged 18 to 34 reporting that they were “very happy” in life fell to 25 percent — the lowest level that the General Social Survey has ever recorded for that population.","images":[],"frames":[2400,22880]},{"text":"The research tells us that the ebb and flow of happiness in America is clearly linked to the quality and character of our social ties — including our friendships,  community ties,  and marriage. It’s also linked,  specifically,  to the frequency with which we have sex.","images":[],"frames":[22880,40480]},{"text":"An analysis revealed that the decline in sexual frequency can account for about one-third of the decline in happiness since 2012. Declines in marriage and religiosity have also played some role,  but the effects are much smaller — with each factor only accounting for about a tenth of the decline in happiness. But for the rise in regular friend contact over the past few years,  young men and women would be even less happy.","images":[],"frames":[40480,69440]},{"text":"Thus,  while most of the decline in happiness is about declining sex,  that’s not the end of the story. Declining sex is at least partly about family and religious changes that make it harder for people to achieve stable,  coupled life at a young age.","images":[],"frames":[69440,87520]},{"text":"","images":[],"frames":[87520,89520]}],"id":486,"engTitle":"The Happiness Recession "}
