It is lively,  colourful and genuinely funny,  and doesn’t break what didn’t need fixing about the original."},{"frames":[16320,48960],"images":[],"text":"Any Hollywood movie set in a fantasy Arab kingdom is going to have its issues,  but Disney has sought to avoid the ethnic stereotyping that marred its 1992 animation. For starters,  the cast are brown-skinned actors. Egyptian-Canadian Mena Massoud brings the requisite roguish charm to Aladdin himself,  the street rat with a heart of gold. Princess Jasmine is played by Naomi Scott,  a British actor of Indian descent."},{"frames":[48960,59200],"images":[],"text":"But we all know the main draw here is the blue-skinned guy. Will Smith‘s Genie is less cartoonishly manic than Williams’; more human,  you could say."},{"frames":[59200,85600],"images":[],"text":"On the whole,  Ritchie’s adaptation wisely does little except add human flesh to the bare bones of what was always one of Disney’s strongest stories. It still holds up as a tale whose “it’s what’s inside that counts” morals are in the right place. That’s really all anyone wanted out of a new Aladdin: not a whole new world,  just a slightly updated old one."},{"frames":[85600,87600],"images":[],"text":""}]}
