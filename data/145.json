We're saving it for a friend.","Who may not return the favor. Abdullah Almaatouq of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleagues recently showed that people are poor judges of who their friends are.","When the researchers asked 84 college students to identify which of their classmates qualified as friends,  the researchers found that in half the cases,  those labeled friends failed to reciprocate the designation.","Friendships are also surprisingly fragile. Based on a detailed survey of 540 participants,  researchers at Oxford University determined that people had a falling out with a member of their social circle about once every 7.2 months,  and that a year later 40 percent of those ruptures remained unhealed.","Sure,  love may mean never having to say you're sorry. But friendship is a stricter taskmaster,  and sorry may not be enough."]}
