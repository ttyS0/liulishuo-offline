For every liter of potable water produced,  the UN estimates about 1.5 liters of liquid polluted with chlorine and copper are created. When pumped back into the ocean,  the toxic brine depletes oxygen and impacts organisms along the food chain.","frames":[38880,63550]},{"images":[],"text":"Saudi Arabia’s desalination plants produce about 31.5 million cubic meters of contaminated water each day. That volume of liquid is equivalent to about 20 million barrels of oil a day,  or,  double the amount of crude it currently produces.
