More than half of women surveyed by the state-run China Youth Daily newspaper in 2015 said they had experienced \"inappropriate touching\" on public transportation in China.","The designated subway cars — two at the back of the line — are meant to be in effect only on weekdays and during the morning and evening rush hours. The doors for those cars are labeled \"women cars\" in pink Chinese characters and festooned with illustrations of blossoms.","The problem: Men are claiming them. Weary subway workers,  wearing red vests emblazoned with the word \"volunteer, \" say that shortly after the cars were designated for women,  they tried dissuading male passengers,  with little success. It is,  perhaps,  an inescapable reality in one of the world's busiest metro systems. In a day,  there are roughly eight million passenger trips on the Guangzhou subway,  said Ye Zichuan,  the head of Guangzhou Metro's publicity department."]}
