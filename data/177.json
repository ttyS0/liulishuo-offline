Two months ago,  the Department of Justice quietly offered a settlement to Wilson,  essentially agreeing with his argument. Somewhere in between then and now,  Wilson evidently accepted.","frames":[49100,75960]},{"images":[],"text":"What it means: Digital weapons files can now be distributed on the web without regulation. Wilson is relaunching Defcad.com on August 1. The website will host the original 3-D-printable gun model along with new designs that require machining by programmable manufacturing machines,  like CNCs,  to produce. Users will be able to contribute their own models as well. “What's about to happen is a Cambrian explosion of the digital content related to firearms, ” Wilson told Wired.","frames":[76240,109000]},{"images":[],"text":"But makers will need to have a working knowledge of gun mechanics,  3-D printing,  and manufacturing technologies like CNCs to construct a weapon from these files. While Wilson has lowered some of the barriers to creating undocumented weapons in your garage,  home-based setups will have to advance mightily before your neighbors will all be making AR-15s in their basements.","frames":[109220,132220]}],"author":"枪支朗读改 ","shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1532600835262-11.jpg","id":177,"posterUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1532582347460-21.jpg","duration":131361,"url":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1532608341244-17.mp3","engTitle":"The files you need to make your own gun can now be legally shared online","title":"在美国，自造枪支所需的文件如今可在网上合法共享"}
