The quality that draws him to hire is neither credentials nor competence nor even ideological compatibility but an impulse that he has chemistry with the applicant. It's less like OkCupid,  on which people seek prospective partners,  than Tinder,  where people go for a hookup.","Signs of a Tinder presidency: Of the 23 officials who took the oath of office on Trump's first weekday in office,  14 are now gone. That's 61 percent. A quarter of Trump's core Cabinet members have departed. This week alone,  Trump's homeland security adviser quit,  as did the deputy national security adviser for strategy and the National Security Council spokesman. This came with the arrival of Trump's third national security adviser in 15 months.","It's clear why. Trump's tastes change frequently. Those who do choose to serve this president — never from the top advisers — find it difficult to keep up with the loyalty it requires: not to an ideology or a party,  but to ever-changing presidential impulses. To use a Tinderism,  Trump is here for a good time,  not a long time."]}
