For most of people,  socializing after work means going to the pub for drinks. But in Finland it's perfectly natural to have seen your boss without a stitch of clothing. In a Finnish company,  teams would get together in the sauna to celebrate company successes and milestones.","Finn Tommi Uitto,  senior vice president of global product sales of Nokia,  explains,  \"In the sauna there are no clothes,  no titles,  no egos. It's only you and your thoughts and your words to the other person,  so it's much more human being to human being and all the unnecessary decoration is gone.\"","Nokia has an in-house sauna at each of its three sites on Finnish soil. \"It's a given, \" says Uitto. \"Any Finn applying for a job in a Finnish company would expect that there is a sauna.\"","But in recent years,  however,  the sauna has become less of a focal point,  partly because Finnish firms have become more global."]}
