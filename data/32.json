SpaceX ultimately intends to put about 12, 000 broadband satellites in low Earth orbit,  and Sunday's payload will mark the company's first attempt at realizing the dream.","frames":[18470,38400],"images":[]},{"text":"Satellite broadband is already available. But it's slow,  expensive and not really accessible to the masses. The goal of SpaceX is to deliver fast,  reliable Internet access to virtually everyone.","frames":[39270,52500],"images":[]},{"text":"Unlike the traditional satellite broadband connection,  Musk plans to put satellites in a much lower orbit around earth. This will reduce the amount of time it takes for signals to travel from ground-based antennas up to space,  and speed up the connection. With 12, 000 of these satellites in low-earth orbit,  the entire world might just be able to have fast reliable Wi-Fi in the not-too-distant future.","frames":[53320,79420],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1520076515150-rc-upload-1520076378553-12.png","id":32}
