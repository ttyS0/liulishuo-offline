SpaceX ultimately intends to put about 12, 000 broadband satellites in low Earth orbit,  and Sunday's payload will mark the company's first attempt at realizing the dream.","Satellite broadband is already available. But it's slow,  expensive and not really accessible to the masses. The goal of SpaceX is to deliver fast,  reliable Internet access to virtually everyone.","Unlike the traditional satellite broadband connection,  Musk plans to put satellites in a much lower orbit around earth. This will reduce the amount of time it takes for signals to travel from ground-based antennas up to space,  and speed up the connection. With 12, 000 of these satellites in low-earth orbit,  the entire world might just be able to have fast reliable Wi-Fi in the not-too-distant future."]}
