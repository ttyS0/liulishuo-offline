Edwards’s 160 clients also include a few cats and monkeys,  though her primary focus is still canines. She advises their “humans” on growth strategies and brand management,  and books for paid posts,  ad campaigns,  and in-person appearances around the country.","frames":[11290,61410]},{"images":[],"text":"“There was no central hub pulling together this new pet influencer space, ” she says. “Brands were sending direct messages to hundreds of pets and hearing back from a fraction of them. These humans a lot of times have full-time jobs,  they’re not checking their dog’s email regularly. So there was definitely a need to kind of pull everything together.”","frames":[61640,83640]},{"images":[],"text":"Today,  Edwards’s portfolio includes both superstar influencers–like @tunameltsmyheart,  a chihuahua-dachshund mix with 2 million followers–and up-and-comers,  like Chase,  whose account @sometimescarl   has a still-impressive 85, 000-follower reach. Her clients have worked with plenty of pet supply companies on product placements and ads,  but also book gigs with human brands like Dyson,  the Ritz Carlton,  and Ralph Lauren.","frames":[83170,113880]},{"images":[],"text":"","frames":[113880,118880]}],"author":"1.7 网红狗 Daniel","shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1546575283670-2.jpg","id":343,"posterUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1546575283670-24.jpg","duration":114260,"url":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1546575283670-26.mp3","engTitle":"Dog influencers are so popular, they need their own talent agency","title":"网红狗狗如此受欢迎，以至于它们都需要自己的经纪公司了"}
