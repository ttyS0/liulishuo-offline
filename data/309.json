Social media use has also been linked with depression,  particularly among young people.","A recent survey of American holiday-makers by OnePoll found that more than 20% said they checked their smartphones once per hour during their most recent vacation. In a Deloitte survey in Britain in 2017,  38% of adults said they thought they were using their smartphone too much.","As a result,  there has been a surge of interest in so-called digital detox holidays,  as people look for ways to take a break from their phones,  with travel companies and hotels cashing in people’s inability to switch off their devices unless forced.","Ayana resort’s no-phone policy is unlikely to be popular with everyone however. Another recent survey by Travelzoo found that 30% of respondents booked holiday destinations on the basis they would make great fodder for social media."]}
