She's been dubbed a \"subversive\" figure associated with the gangster lifestyle of young Chinese adults,  and banned from a social media platform there.","More than 30, 000 videos of Peppa that used the hashtag \"#PeppaPig\" have reportedly been deleted from the website Douyin because,  according to an internal memo obtained by CNN,  Peppa was \"spreading negative social influence.\"","Since debuting to huge numbers on Chinese television,  Peppa has become quite popular with younger Chinese adults in the \"shehuiren subculture, \" according to the Chinese tabloid Global Times.","This group has embraced Peppa as something of an ironic symbol,  getting tattoos of the pig and popularizing the strange rhyme,  â€œget your Peppa Pig tatt,  shout out to your frat, \" per Australia's SBS News.","It's also not the first time Peppa has found herself the object of scrutiny. One episode of the show has been pulled from Australian television for implying spiders are harmless,  which,  in Australia,  they most certainly are not.","While Peppa's fate on Douyin remains up in the air,  one thing is certain: In 30 years,  tattoo removal services in China will experience a windfall as older adults line up to take care of regrettable life choices."]}
