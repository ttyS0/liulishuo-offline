What happened in the referendum vote was seismic,  but more seismic still was the realisation that this vote was reflecting change,  not just instigating it.\"","But any hope for quick change in Northern Ireland,  the only part of the United Kingdom where terminations are almost always illegal,  appears improbable. May's minority Conservative government relies on support from MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party for a majority in the British parliament -- and the Protestant DUP strongly opposes abortion law reform.","Among the crowds celebrating the referendum outcome at Dublin Castle where the result was announced,  were many from Northern Ireland. A demonstrator from Belfast said the Republic of Ireland was giving a voice to women.\"In Northern Ireland,  we don't have a voice, \" said Sarah,  26. \"We're really a tiny place,  there's not that many of us and we can only shout loud now.\""]}
