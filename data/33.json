New York,  London and Milan have their appeal,  but Paris—where fashion shows have taken place since the 1700s—has more cachet.","It's not just homegrown talent like Chanel,  Christian Dior and Saint Laurent; in recent years some of the world's biggest brands have abandoned the alternatives for the City of Lights and its commercial opportunities (some international buyers and journalists do not attend the others).","It is also a big deal for France. The French Fashion Institute reckons the industry is worth about €150bn ($184bn) a year,  making it bigger for the country than aerospace or cars.","Globally however,  business has hit the doldrums. A campaign against corruption in China has made conspicuous apparel unfashionable there. And old marketing ideas,  like shunning online channels to remain exclusive,  now seem stuffy. Increasingly,  houses of haute couture must think beyond the catwalk to stay à la mode."]}
