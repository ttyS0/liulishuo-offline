Audiences in North America will have the chance to see it starting Dec. 21.","Why didn’t Warner just release “Aquaman” this weekend in North America as well?","The two weekends after Thanksgiving in the United States are typically among the slowest moviegoing periods of the year,  as holiday shopping and related festivities take priority. There were no new wide-release films over the weekend in North America,  where the No.1 movie was once again “Ralph Breaks the Internet” (Disney),  which collected about $16.1 million,  for a three-week domestic total of $140.9 million,  according to comScore."]}
