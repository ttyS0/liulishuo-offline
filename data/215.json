{"title":"Sorry to Bother You: is this the most shocking anti-capitalist film ever?","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1535709170923-40.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1535709170923-38.jpg","contents":["Sorry to Bother You,  a comedy-drama starring Lakeith Stanfield,  is one of the most anti-capitalist movies Hollywood has ever produced. We’re used to seeing the rich portrayed as evil,  but here we see people sell their souls to ascend the corporate ladder.","Stanfield’s character,  Cassius “Cash” Green,  a low-level telemarketer,  learns that,  in order to succeed at work,  he has to put on a white voice. To see a black actor adopt such a voice is a gag that never stops giving. But on a deeper level,  watching Cash learn to “sound white”,  and have his career skyrocket as a result,  is a superb parody of something that many black people in the corporate world have found: in order to succeed,  you have to perform your personality in a way that is pleasing to white people.","Ultimately,  the film is a devastating takedown of capitalism,  portraying people giving up their freedom so they don’t have to worry about money. Owners and management are shown as depraved evil,  scheming to create workers who are ever cheaper,  more compliant and more profitable.","This is the genius of the film: it indicts the entire system. It is critical that workers believe they have a chance to ascend,  so they will keep working. And it’s critical that the wealthy believe they’ll never fall off their perches,  so they’ll keep taking chances,  keep investing.","It shows us a capitalism that promises us happiness through rampant consumption. The wealthy grow wealthier,  the middle class shrinks and the number of poor people swells."]}
