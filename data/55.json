In a statement Saturday,  Facebook said,  \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","Former director of FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection David Vladeck said that violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40, 000 per violation,  meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true,  the company's possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Even though such a fine is unlikely,   the final penalty still could be very large."]}
