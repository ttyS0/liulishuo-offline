It is also an experiment that tests consumer comfort levels with unmanned commerce in China.","Inside the hotel,  softly-lit white panelled walls bring to mind the interiors of Hollywood spaceships. Guests check in at podiums that scan their faces,  as well as passports or other ID. Visitors with a Chinese national ID can scan their faces using their smartphones to check in ahead of time.","At the hotel's restaurant,  taller capsule-shaped robots deliver food that guests have ordered via the FlyZoo app while at a separate bar,  a large robotic arm can mix more than 20 different types of cocktails. Facial recognition cameras add charges to the room rate automatically.","The hotel does employ humans,  though Alibaba declined to specify how many. This includes chefs and cleaners as well as reception staff,  who will assist with conventional check-in procedures for guests unwilling to have their faces scanned and want to use electronic key cards."]}
