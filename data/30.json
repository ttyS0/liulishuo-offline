He was a member of the US Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps,  a school programme for potential US military officers. He was shot down last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as he held open a door so others could escape.","Mr. Wang's funeral on Tuesday was attended by hundreds of people. He lay in an open coffin in the small chapel at Kraeer Funeral Home,  dressed in a Junior R.O.T.C. uniform like the one he wore the day he was killed,  with the Medal for Heroism pinned to his chest. A line of mourners,  many of them in uniform,  stretched out of the chapel.","Veterans from all over the country began a campaign to mail military patches to Mr. Wang's family. And those who knew him spoke in tribute. \"He was always looking to do things for others before himself, \" said a classmate,  Logan De Lima,  13."]}
