That's exactly what's happening as cacao plants are on track to go extinct by 2050,  according to Business Insider.","frames":[6320,21300],"images":[]},{"text":"Cacao trees can only grow within 20 degrees north and south of the equator,  and they need high humidity,   nitrogen-rich soil,  and steady temperatures to thrive. Scientists predict that rising temperatures and moisture loss will affect the three countries that lead cacao production: Côte d'Ivoire,  Ghana,  and Indonesia.","frames":[21700,42820],"images":[]},{"text":"Luckily for cacao farmers and chocolate fiends,  scientists at the University of California,  Berkeley and the global confectionery company Mars are collaborating to modify the DNA of the cacao plants,  enabling them to grow in different elevations while being disease-resistant. Therefore,  The question is not whether or not chocolate will be around in 2050,  the question is how much it will cost future generations to buy and if genetic modification can play a role in its future production.","frames":[43440,75640],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1517224352116-rc-upload-1517224122102-17.jpg","id":6}
