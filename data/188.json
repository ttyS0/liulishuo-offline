Sulzberger then issued a statement that opened an exchange over whose activities were more damaging to America.","Sulzberger said he had raised “concerns about the president's deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric” and “implored him to reconsider his broader attacks on journalism,  which I believe are dangerous and harmful to our country”.","He did not say how the president responded. Hours later,  Trump obliged. In a multi-tweet rant,  he claimed reports on “internal deliberations of our government … truly put the lives of many,  not just journalists,  at risk”. Claiming without evidence that “90% of media coverage of my administration is negative”,  Trump said he would “not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the dying newspaper industry”.","Sulzberger,  37,  took over from his father on 1 January. In his statement,  he said: “I told the president directly that I thought that his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous. I told him that although the phrase ‘fake news’ is untrue and harmful,  I am far more concerned about his labelling journalists ‘the enemy of the people’.”"]}
