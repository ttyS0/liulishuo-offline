Now they are as likely to involve video games. The latest must-have is \"Fortnite Battle Royale\",  a lighthearted multiplayer shooter in which up to 100 players parachute on to a continually shrinking playing field,  hunt each other down and compete to be the last one standing.","It is wildly popular. One estimate is that it had 45m players in March. And \"Fortnite\" is interesting for a good reason. It shows the long-established influence within video-gaming of hands-on tinkering,  in which players take existing products and splice together \"mods\",  or modifications,  which change how the game is played.","This tinkering culture is not unique to video games. Music has remixing and sampling; publishing has fan-fiction. But modding is bigger than either in its scope. Big mods are serious software projects,  requiring programmers,  artists,  level designers and more,  all of whom give their time free. Many in the games business got their start in modding,  disassembling their favorite games,  sculpting them into something new and learning about digital artistry along the way. Worried parents might reassure themselves with the thought that,  if their children get interested enough,  their hobby might one day turn into a career."]}
