They speak more purposefully and carefully,  typical of someone speaking a second or third language. Anglophones,  on the other hand,  often talk too fast for others to follow,  and use jokes,  slang and references specific to their own culture.","When trying to communicate in English with a group of people with varying levels of fluency,  it's important to be receptive and adaptable. \"People who've learned other languages are good at that,  but native speakers of English generally are monolingual and not very good at tuning in to language variation, \" Jenkins says."]}
