But they also led to unforeseen harm,  from urban sprawl to road rage and climate change. Now,  just like automobiles once did,  AVs are ready to rewrite the rules of transport.","AVs would dramatically reduce the number of road deaths and,  being electric,  cut harmful emissions in places with clean grids. Clever routing,  closer spacing between vehicles and dynamic congestion-charging could also cut traffic.","In addition,  AVs will record everything that happens in and around them. When a crime is committed,  the police will ask nearby cars if they saw anything.","However,  today the danger is that AVs will be treated merely as a technological solution to the problems associated with cars and that,  once again,  the wider impacts will be overlooked."]}
