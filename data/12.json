These days the song seems to describe more and more people. In fact,  loneliness has become such a problem in the United Kingdom (UK) that the country now has a Minister of Loneliness.","On Wednesday,  January 17,  British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the creation of this new position. May stated,  \"For far too many people,  loneliness is the sad reality of modern life.\" The announcement cited the statistic that more than 9 million people always or often feel lonely in the UK.","Tracey Crouch,  a junior minister for sport and civil society will serve as the inaugural Minister of Loneliness. Crouch's office will now help spearhead a number of initiatives including developing an overall strategy on how to address loneliness in England and a dedicated fund  to combat it.","Everyone feels lonely sometimes because some degree of loneliness is part of the human existence. But statistics suggest that the rate of loneliness is increasing,  which means that some things are changing in our society for the worse. And the UK government has decided that they can't leave these problems alone."]}
