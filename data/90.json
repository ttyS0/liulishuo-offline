The two men were arrested for \"trespassing\" while they were waiting for a friend in the store.","John Gordon,  a restaurant industry analyst said: \"There has to be a situation every day where some human being handles things wrong. You can't have that many employees and not have something stupid happen. Even with a huge operations manual that lays out what to say and what to do,  you can't cover everything.\""]}
