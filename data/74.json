The gang could smuggle as many as 15, 000 phones across the border in one night,  it said.","Regulating the use of drones has become an important task for China,  the world's largest manufacturer of consumer drones.","China published strict rules last year to tackle incidents of drones straying into aircraft flight paths,  including requiring owners of civilian drones to register craft up to a certain weight under their real names.","Shenzhen customs would closely monitor new types of smuggling with high-tech devices and enhance their capability with technical equipment,  including drones and high-resolution monitors,  to detect smuggling activity."]}
