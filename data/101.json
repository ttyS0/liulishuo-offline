By doing this,  you can trick the brain into thinking something it hasn't felt or sensed before.","For example,  they hope that the technique could,  one day,  be used to control prosthetic limbs,  enable paralyzed people to feel touch or even allow the blind to see by converting the images from a camera lens into real brain activity.","But it may also have more profound implications. Such an ability could pave the way for technologies that may enable us to replace painful emotions or insert memories into our minds of things that we never saw.","The technology is still in its very early stages at the moment: it only works on a tiny section of the brain. However,  the team hopes that they can scale-up the technique to affect larger areas of the brain—and therefore have a larger influence on behavior."]}
