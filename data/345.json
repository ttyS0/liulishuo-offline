Trump’s demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800, 000 federal workers.","Before meeting with lawmakers,  Trump said the shutdown would last for “as long as it takes” as he pushes for wall money as part of any legislation to reopen agencies shuttered when their funding lapsed on Dec. 22.","“We know that we have a challenge along the border, ” said Kevin McCarthy,  the top House Republican. “We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day,  the president,  listening to him,  he wants to solve this as well.”","Trump made the border wall a key part of his presidential campaign. Before meeting with the Democrats,  Trump called the border a “sieve, ” provided an estimate of the U.S. illegal immigrant population far higher than the figures most experts cite and made disputed comments about progress towards building a wall.","The $5 billion Trump is seeking would cover only a portion of the money needed for a border wall,  a project estimated to cost about $23 billion. Trump had said Mexico would pay for the wall,  but Mexico has refused."]}
