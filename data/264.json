{"title":"The gig economy: workers on tap （Part 2）","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1540105458955-9.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1540105458955-4.jpg","contents":["However,  the fact that it is smaller than you might think is not the gig economy's strongest defence. That rests on how gigging brings important benefits to the economy. The advantages for consumers are clear. With a swipe or a click,  almost anyone can get Rover walked in the park or a vital document copy-edited within hours.","Crucially,  benefits also accrue to workers. The algorithms that underpin gig-economy platforms improve the \"matching\" between giggers and jobs,  leading to less dead time. The evidence that gig workers face a pay penalty compared with conventional employees is patchy; many say they value the extra autonomy they enjoy compared with salaried workers. Gig platforms are a useful way of topping up income or smoothing out earnings if other sources of work dry up. They can also break open closed industries. Research shows that the arrival of Uber in American cities leads on average to a 50% surge in the number of self-employed taxi-drivers.","But the gig economy is not perfect. Platforms argue they are no more than neutral marketplaces in which workers and customers meet. By this logic,  workers ought to count as self-employed. But the standards to which some platforms hold workers tell a different story. Food-delivery riders are often told to wear a uniform; drivers for ride-hailing apps need to maintain a good rating or can be kicked off the platform. Platforms have a legitimate interest in maintaining their quality of service. But it cannot be right that some firms specify how workers must submit to the duties of acting like employees even as they reject the responsibilities of acting like employers."]}
