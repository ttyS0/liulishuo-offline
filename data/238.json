{"title":"Why anti-ageing is out in the beauty industry ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1537871869229-53.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1537439423080-4.jpg","contents":["The term ‘anti-ageing’ may now be taboo,  but the new era of beauty advertising still profits on women’s insecurities.","It is no longer fashionable to be anti-ageing: it has been rebadged as “pro-skin”,  by the founder of American skincare brand Drunk Elephant and “anti-wrinkles” by Neutrogena. A new vocabulary now dominates the language of the beauty industry,  the ethos of body-positivity finally inching its way up to the top.","It falls into a familiar category: stuff you know is basically tripe,  but you can’t really object to because what went before it was worse. Still,  the principle is that any visible sign of ageing is a disgusting thing in a woman,  whether that is a wrinkle or the overall dulling effect of having seen too much life.","Is it in any way preferable for the term “anti-ageing” to become taboo while all its apparatus remains intact? Take the Neutrogena products that dare not say “anti-ageing” still say “anti-wrinkles”. Or does it just resituate the discomfort back with the consumer?","If fear of mortality is universal,  then attempting to erase its reminders is reasonable. It is not a feminist’s duty to look like a tea-towel that got stuck at the back of a tumble dryer. It is where vanity is marshalled by commerce that it becomes oppressive and disproportionate. Anti-ageing is an OK word and an OK pursuit,  so long as you don’t buy into products at all; make face masks out of white wine and bathe in the excretions of a donkey,  like Cleopatra,  who was oppressed by nobody."]}
