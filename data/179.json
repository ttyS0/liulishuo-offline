{"title":"How Mariah Carey's 'I don't know her' became pop's shadiest power move","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1532687993290-25.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1532600835262-20.jpg","contents":["Pop has had some incredible disses. Rihanna saying Diplo's music sounds \"like a reggae song at an airport\". Beyoncé's smirk and eye roll when Kelly Rowland claimed to be the \"second lead\" singer in Destiny's Child. But the greatest—and most enduring—shade of all time has to be when Mariah Carey claimed she didn't know Jennifer Lopez.","Let's go back: in the early 00s,  when asked about her pop rival by paparazzi,  Mariah shook her head and innocently answered: \"I don't know her.\" She did know her: last year,  Irv Gotti claimed that the singers started their feud in 2001 when Mariah was surprised to hear a sample she'd bagged for her then-unreleased song Loverboy pop up on Lopez's hit single I'm Real.","Instead of slagging her off,  Mariah decided to pretend Jennifer Lopez simply didn't exist,  a position she maintains to this day. The success of this tactic means Mariah has also used it on other pop stars,  such as Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande.","But the phrase's enduring legacy (and THAT gif of the moment) means it's the diss that just won't die. Really,  it's the ultimate diss,  a lesson in the art of throwing shade: just denying the very existence of anyone you don't like. In Mariah's case,  it's an overt way of saying that Jennifer Lopez's art – her pop career,  her movies,  her TV work – has made so little impact on the world,  Mariah just hasn't come across her yet. Subtlety? She doesn't know the meaning of it."]}
