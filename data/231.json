{"title":"‘No pain, no gain’sounds tough, but you may only be hurting yourself ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1537182493469-56.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1537182493469-54.jpg","contents":["While training for a half-marathon last fall,  Janet Sherman,  57,  started noticing pain in her right leg and left foot. A diagnosis of a quadriceps strain and plantar fasciitis led to shoe inserts and cross-training. Before long,  the Wyoming-based teacher was \"just good enough\" to get back to training,  and so she did,  although she opted to drop down to a shorter 10K race distance.","On race day,  Sherman's foot began bothering her early,  and by a water stop two-thirds of the way through the course,  she knew she should drop out. \"It was so painful,  but I was stubborn and finished out the race, \" she said. \"Afterward,  I could barely walk.\"","To the inactive,  Sherman's attitude might be hard to understand. But for amateur athletes and weekend warriors,  pushing through pain is a common refrain. \"As a society,  we are more active in sports than ever before, \" said Adrienne Langelier,  a Texas-based sports psychology consultant. \"But at the same time,  as a culture we have developed a 'no days off' mentality.\"","That needs to change,  said Mark Cucuzzella,  a physician and a professor at the West Virginia University School of Medicine. \" 'No pain,  no gain' - no,  thank you, \" he quipped. \"For too long,  we have glamorized that way of thinking. It's not sustainable.\"","Pressing too hard can lead to injury,  illness and exhaustion. With running,  for instance,  pushing through pain can lead to a secondary injury,  said Adam Tenforde of the Spaulding National Running Center at Harvard Medical School. “A stress fracture,  if you continue to run on it,  may progress to a full fracture and require a much longer recovery period,  for example, ” he said. “I advocate for addressing pain early,  rather than ignoring it.”"]}
