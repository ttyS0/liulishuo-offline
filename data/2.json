A clean-up effort has begun and rescue teams have called a halt to the large-scale search for survivors,  reducing it to \"normal\" operations,  CCTV said.","The Sanchi's crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis are all believed to have perished in the incident,  which marks the biggest tanker spill since 1991,  when 260, 000 tonnes of oil leaked off the Angolan coast.","The East China Sea is known for its rich,  although already polluted,  marine ecosystem that includes whales,  porpoises and seabirds. Experts worry the ship's sinking is potentially more damaging to the marine ecosystem than letting the condensate oil burn off."]}
