The country is undergoing changes pushed by Prince Mohammed bin Salman,  including lifting the ban on women driving and the opening of the first cinemas in decades.","But still it remains one of the world's most conservative and opaque countries. Designers were given a host of restrictions,  and none of the models were Saudi. Organizers said the event happening at all was a triumph.","\"We are not doing this to break rules, \" said Princess Al-Saud,  the executive president of the Arab Fashion Council,  which organized the fashion week. \"We are doing this hand-in-hand with the culture and our tradition and religion.\""]}
