He had sought to play down personal clashes with Trump as he wrapped up the summit,  calling the meeting “very successful” and saying he was “inspired by the discussion.” But he also pledged to retaliate against the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum products in defense of Canadian workers.","Earlier in the day,  Trump brought up the prospect of completely eliminating tariffs on goods and services."]}
