The bidding climbed to an extraordinary $1.4 million,  an amount that tied the artist's own auction record from 2008. Finally,  a hammer pounded to signify the end of the auction.","Right then,  the painting's canvas began moving downward,  seeming to pass through its elaborate gilded frame - and reappearing below in neat,  vertical strips. Later,  Sotheby's would explain that a shredder was hidden inside the frame.","\"It appears we just got Banksy-ed, \" Sotheby's senior director Alex Branczik said in a statement that described the incident as \"the first time in auction history that a work of art automatically shredded itself after coming under the hammer.\" He told the outlet,  \"We are busy figuring out what this means in an auction context. The shredding is now part of the integral art work.\"","Banksy later posted a video to Instagram that showed footage of a shredding mechanism being built into the frame. \"A few years ago I secretly built a shredder into a painting, \" he stated in the video text,  \"in case it was ever put up for auctionâ€¦\" The video then jumped to clips of Friday's auction at Sotheby's,  indicating that Banksy - or someone who works with him - was there when it happened.","\"The urge to destroy is also a creative urge, \" Banksy captioned the Instagram post."]}
