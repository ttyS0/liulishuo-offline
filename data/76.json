But Park,  who continues to strongly deny any wrongdoing,  has refused to attend Friday's sentencing.","\"We must hold her accountable to stop such an unfortunate case from dragging the country into turmoil again, \" said Kim Se-yoon,  the lead judge in the case.","For many South Koreans,  the case starkly illustrated widespread feelings that the system is stacked against them and that only the rich and well-connected can get ahead.","After the sentencing,  South Korea's presidential Blue House issued a poetic statement,  \"Each person would have had different feelings about former President Park. However,  a bleak and dry wind blew across all of us today. This is a heartbreaking incident for one person's life as well as for the country as a whole.\""]}
