It really could be the case,  now that researchers from Columbia University have developed a method called FontCode,  which plants data in text through tiny changes in how the letters are shaped.","frames":[5980,30620]},{"images":[],"text":"The method is a steganographic technique,  meaning it hides secret information in plain sight such that only its intended recipient knows where to look for it and how to extract it.","frames":[31000,43660]},{"images":[],"text":"The text perturbations FontCode uses to embed a message involve slightly changing curvatures,  widths,  and heights—but crucially it's all imperceptible to the naked eye. The only easy way to extract the hidden information in all those tiny tweaks is with the research teams' decoding algorithm. A recipient of a FontCode message could use their smartphone to take a picture of text manipulated with FontCode,  then run the photo through a dedicated mobile app that decrypts the code to pull out the hidden message.","frames":[44140,82020]},{"images":[],"text":"\"It's exciting to see new techniques for steganography being invented, \" says security researcher Campbell-Moore. \"I think this technique has a lot of appeal.\"","frames":[82540,92700]}],"author":"Laura","shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1527677789104-8.jpg","id":119,"posterUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1527677789104-4.jpg","duration":93006,"url":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1527677789104-6.mp3","engTitle":"Speaking through fonts – how to hide your message in plain sight","title":"通过字体来传话——如何把你的信息藏在大庭广众之下"}
