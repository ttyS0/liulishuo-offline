For years sewage has been indiscriminately dumped into the sea. Now the president calls it a \"cesspool\".","Maya Bay in Thailand,  the backpacker getaway depicted in the film \"The Beach\",  is a rubble-strewn,  tourist-ravaged mess with 4, 000 visitors a day. It will shut in June for four months to recover. Last year Indonesian officials declared a \"garbage emergency\" across a 6km stretch of Bali.","Such man-made troubles have serious local consequences: 36, 000 jobs are at risk on Boracay,  which accounts for a fifth of the country's tourism revenues.","Officials might experiment with capping the number of visitors or boosting fees for the most delicate tourist hotspots. Or they could divert holidaymakers to lesser-known getaways. For now,  they have more immediate concerns: yesterday clean-up divers at Boracay began their work. It's a small start."]}
