For about half of us,  this isn't really an issue. It's estimated that some 50% of the population isn't really morning or evening-oriented,  but somewhere in the middle.","Numerous studies have found that morning people are more persistent,  self-directed and agreeable. They set higher goals for themselves,  plan for the future more and have a better sense of well-being.","Although morning types may achieve more academically,  night owls tend to perform better on measures of memory,  processing speed and cognitive ability,  even when they have to perform those tasks in the morning. And one study showed that night owls  are as healthy and wise as morning types â€“ and a little bit wealthier.","Still think the morning people sound more like CEO material?
