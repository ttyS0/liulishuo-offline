Millennial couples are in no hurry  ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1529041396088-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1529041396088-4.jpg","contents":["When it comes to serious lifelong relationships,  new research suggests,  millennials proceed with caution. Young adults are not only marrying and having children later in life than previous generations,  but taking more time to get to know each other before they tie the knot.

They have been dating since they were in high school and have lived together in New York City since graduating from college,  but are in no rush to get married.","Ms. Simson said: “I'll get married when my life is more in order.” She has a long to-do list to get through before then,  starting with the couple paying down student loans and gaining more financial security.

Now it is often the last.”"]}
