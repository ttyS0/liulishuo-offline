{"title":"#10YearChallenge: harmless trend or boon to facial recognition technology?","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1548646111589-16.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1548646111589-14.jpg","contents":["The #10YearChallenge gained widespread traction on social media this month. It calls for posting two photos of yourself side by side—one from today and one from a decade ago—to show how you’ve changed. People are participating mostly on Facebook and Instagram,  which is owned by Facebook.","Some made jokes,  paid tribute to old hairstyles or drew attention to issues like global warming. Celebrities posted glamour shots that showed negligible changes from one decade to the next.","But one post went viral without featuring any side-by-side photos. It was written by Kate O’Neill,  author of the book “Tech Humanist: How You Can Make Technology Better for Business and Better for Humans.”","“Me 10 years ago: probably would have played along with the profile picture aging meme going around on Facebook and Instagram, ” she wrote in a tweet last week. “Me now: ponders how all this data could be mined to train facial recognition algorithms on age progression and age recognition.”","Her words hit a nerve. People responded with concerns about whether they were helping the tech giant get better at identifying people. O’Neill’s post got more than 10, 000 retweets and more than 20, 000 likes.","Lauren A. Rhue,  an assistant professor at the Wake Forest School of Business,  said people should be wary of any company being in possession of such a large trove of biometric data. “There are things we don’t think of as being threats, ” Rhue said. “And then five or ten years from now,  we realize that there is a threat,  but the data has already been given.”"]}
