Trouble is,  the extra weight you might have noticed isn't going anywhere.","Holiday weight gain is a well-studied phenomenon,  and researchers have found that people gain about a pound from November to January. That might not sound like much,  and it certainly is less than people think they gain (about 5 pounds). But that extra pound lingers. In the same study,  researchers found that people don't tend to shed that winter weight by the next year. After a few sugary Christmas seasons (plus the year's other indulgent holidays,  birthdays and anniversaries),  those pounds add up.","Unfortunately,  that's a problem for many Americans. About 70% of U.S. adults are overweight or obese,  and gaining weight in adulthood is a risk factor for all kinds of bad outcomes,  including type-2 diabetes . Once it's on,  losing weight can be incredibly challenging. New evidence suggests that once you gain weight,  your body will work against you to keep it there.","The best advice,  of course,  is to try to avoid holiday weight gain in the first place. When you can't resist indulging,  pick your very favorite dessert,  but eat only the amount that it will take for you to be satisfied. Also,  maintain a consistent aerobic exercise routine. It may help offset some of the inflammation and blood sugar spikes that accompany overeating."]}
