But it's the last third of \"The Attention Merchants, \" in which Mr. Wu charts the rise and fall of the internet,  that is truly memorable.","frames":[13720,26520],"images":[]},{"text":"Mr. Wu is aware of the web's virtues,  not least of which is that it connects us to others.

And how connected are we,  really,  under the new terms and conditions of our lives?","frames":[27160,49100],"images":[]},{"text":"So in the final chapters of his book,  Mr. Wu implores us to regain custody of our attention.

Yet never,  it seems,  have we belonged less to ourselves.","frames":[49800,67540],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1517559143106-rc-upload-1517540294859-6.png","id":14}
