Love Yourself: Tear by K-pop group BTS has managed to clinch the No 1 spot,  outperforming industry predictions.","The record's success comes at a time of huge opportunity in the US music industry for acts that don't perform in English.","In the past three years,  the proportion of non-English tracks on Billboard has been increasing. This has,  in large part,  been down to the success of reggaeton artists and,  in particular,  Despacito. It opened the door for other latin tracks. In 2016,  the year before its release,  there were just four Spanish-language tracks in the top 100 all year. In 2017,  there were 19.","Spanish has long been the most commonly learned language in the US,  but the influence of K-pop is being felt in the languages young Americans are learning.","Priscilla Kim is the director of the Korean Cultural Center in New York. She says that,  among younger students,  K-pop has become a driving factor to learn the language. \"We have courses in the summer that are tailored toward K-pop fans who are interested in learning Korean through K-pop lyrics.\"","The rapid chart surge for non-English music in the past few years suggests this may just be the beginning.","At a time where some Americans are concerned that speaking other languages in public puts themselves in danger,  pop music feels like a progressive antidote,  with the importance of what language a song is performed in second to the music itself."]}
