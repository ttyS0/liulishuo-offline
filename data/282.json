{"title":"Jair Bolsonaro, far-right populist, elected president of Brazil  ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1541589990983-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1541589990983-4.jpg","contents":["Brazil on Sunday became the latest country to drift toward the far right,  electing a strident populist as president in the nation’s most radical political change since democracy was restored more than 30 years ago.","The new president,  Jair Bolsonaro,  won by tapping into a deep well of resentment at the status quo in Brazil—a country whiplashed by rising crime and two years of political and economic turmoil—and by presenting himself as the alternative.","“We have everything we need to become a great nation, ” Bolsonaro said Sunday night in a video broadcast on his Facebook account shortly after the race was called. “Together we will change the destiny of Brazil.”","Bolsonaro,  who will take the helm of Latin America’s biggest nation,  is farther to the right than any president in the region.","Reeling from the deepest recession in the country’s history,  a corruption scandal that tarnished politicians across the ideological spectrum,  and a record-high number of homicides last year,  Brazilians picked a candidate who not only rejected the political establishment but at times also seemed to reject the most basic democratic tenets.","Part of the reason for his victory was the collapse of the left. Many cried foul after former President Luiz Inácio da Silva,  the longtime front-runner in the race,  was ruled ineligible after he was imprisoned in April to start serving a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering."]}
