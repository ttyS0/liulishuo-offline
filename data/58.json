{"title":"China’s influencer industry: Not just a pretty face","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/1522315482424-rc-upload-1522315412001-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1522315447797-rc-upload-1522315412001-4.png","contents":["Papi Jiang,  a comedian,  pokes fun at stardom and Chinese society in salty tirades. The Swiss watchmaker Jaeger-LeCoultre hired her for a video ad targeting young urbanites,  including her 27m fans on Sina Weibo,  a Twitter-like microblog.","Ms Jiang is wanghong,  literally \"red-hot on the web\". Everyday millions of Chinese trawl social media for wanghong posts or tune in to live-streams for opinions. The fans are helping them to monetise their popularity—and to shake up the country's e-commerce industry in the process. Unlike conventional brand ambassadors,  many wanghong have built their fan bases through compelling online content rather than a famous name.","The wanghong economy looks poised to grow. In 2016 it was already 15% bigger than the Chinese film industry's gross box-office sales. This year it could surpass 100bn yuan.","Like all branding,  however,  the influencer business is a delicate one. Many starlets expect to quit after a couple of years. Some brands have started to look for lesser-known influencers,  who command smaller fees and retain a more authentic image among devotees. It is hard to stay red-hot for long."]}
