Kostarev said a large portion of the résumés posted to job sites belong to people who are no longer looking for employment. Human recruiters waste hours filtering through candidates who aren't available.","Yet he still sees a vital role for human recruiters and face-to-face interviews.","\"As far as searches for executive hires,  I don't see any opportunities for the robot to do that job, \" he said. \"Humans can do it much better. What I do see is that recruiters will begin managing AI more and more and using it as a tool to do their job more efficiently.\""]}
