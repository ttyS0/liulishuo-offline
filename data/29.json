It's difficult to stay cool in the middle of a shopping,  drinking,  and gifting frenzy,  and to avoid the blues when regular life resumes again.","\"The terms post-holiday 'blues' are so dramatic, \" writes Australian psychologist and wellness expert Melissa Weinberg. \"What we experience is a post-holiday normalization.\" That disappointed or deflated feeling that follows an exciting event is a natural response to life's dramas.","Instead of resisting disappointment,  accept it. Reflect on what you expected and what you experienced,  try to identify the gap between the two,  and move on. If you reject reality,  you may end up in experiencing surges of hope followed by crashes of disappointment. Psychologists suggest adopting an \"acceptance mindset, \" recognizing reality is unlikely to meet your heightened,  hopeful expectations.","Your blues,  like the excitement that preceded them,  are temporary and natural,  so you needn't fight bad feelings or cling to good ones. The best way to deal with this is to examine your states—without judgment—knowing feelings and circumstances will shift again,  and practice celebrating real life with all its many quirks."]}
