{"title":"Natalie Portman astonishes in remarkably intimate portrait","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1523425828148-8.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1517217216854-rc-upload-1517217196417-4.jpg","contents":["Jackie is a remarkably raw portrait of an iconic American first lady. Powered by an astonishing performance from Natalie Portman,  this unconventional bio-drama also marks an English-language debut for Pablo,  the gifted Chilean director.","Portman is altogether astonishing in the role. Apart from sharing a wide smile,  she doesn't much resemble Kennedy. She is however gifted with an overpowering beauty. Most importantly,  Portman thoroughly nails Kennedy's breathy and docile-sounding voice,  without letting the affectations get the better of her.","In a key sequence that follows the assassination,  we see Kennedy shower her husband's blood off her hair,  struggle to rip off her crimson-stained pantyhose,  and then finally,  lie in bed alone. It's a singular vision from an uncompromising director that happens to be about one of the most famous women in American history.","Jackie is not Oscar bait – it's great cinema."]}
