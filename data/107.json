At those extreme temperatures,  the propellant would need to be loaded just before takeoff — while astronauts are aboard. An accident,  or a spark,  during this maneuver,  known as \"load-and-go, \" could set off an explosion.","Elon Musk's flare have collided with a bureaucratic system at NASA that has been accused of being overly conservative in the wake of two shuttle disasters that killed 14 astronauts.","In a recent speech,  Robert Lightfoot,  the former acting NASA administrator,  lamented in candid terms how the agency,  with society as a whole,  has become too risk-averse,  saying: \"I wonder,  if Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong would have ever been able to go to the moon in the risk environment we have today.\""]}
