It has suspended its Hitch carpooling service and previously said that it felt deeply responsible and would complete by Sept. 1 a new compliance operation to be inspected by the ministries and the public.","After a 21-year-old flight attendant was murdered in May,  allegedly by her Didi Hitch driver,  the company took steps including limiting the hours during which carpool drivers can pick up passengers of the opposite sex,  and testing an \"escort mode” on its app enabling passengers to share their routes and destinations with emergency contacts.","The latest killing has been one of the most discussed topics on China's Twitter-like Weibo service since the weekend,  with Didi's official apology post gaining more than 500, 000 comments.","Many Chinese netizens said that they wanted to see key changes being made and that public trust was being eroded as it was not the first incident.","\"I don’t dare to use Didi in the future, \" one said."]}
