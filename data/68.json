Kim was seen clapping in tune to some of the songs and took photographs with the performers after the show.","\"Our dear leader comrade said his heart swelled and he was moved by the sight of his people deepen their understanding of South Korean popular culture and cheer with sincerity, \" the North's KCNA state media said.","Sunday's performance coincided with the start of annual joint South Korean-U.S. military drills,  which have previously been met with denunciations and missile launches by the North,  and were delayed and shortened this year in order not to overshadow the Olympic detente.","The two Koreas are technically still at war after the 1950-1953 conflict ended with a ceasefire rather than a peace agreement."]}
