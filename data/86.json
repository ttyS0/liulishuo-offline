He ended the concert with his self-revealing ballad I. \"I won't hide,  I will live my life the way I like under the bright light, \" he sang,  \"I am what I am,  firelight of a different colour.\"","Hong Kong still lacks anti-discrimination laws protecting LGBT communities but queer identity and sexual fluidity are no longer so taboo and are part of the social landscape. And 15 years after his death,  Cheung is still attracting new fans,  including teenagers and millennials,  by his charisma and androgyny.","\"The highest achievement for a performer is to embody both genders at the same time, \" he once proclaimed: \"For art itself is genderless.\""]}
