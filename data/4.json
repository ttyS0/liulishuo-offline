The fashion house is in good company,  joining leading brands Calvin Klein,  Giorgio Armani,  Ralph Lauren and Stella McCartney in the crusade.","Moving forward,  the brand will waste no time capitalizing on old fur items in its inventory. Gucci is set to auction off any remaining fur items with proceeds to benefit the Humane Society and the Italy-based animal-rights organization LAV."]}
