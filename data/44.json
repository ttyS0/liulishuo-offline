The legendary theoretical physicist passed away at home on Wednesday,  March 14,  according to his family.","Hawking was probably the best-known scientist in the world. His early work on black holes transformed how scientists think about the nature of the universe. Before him,  physicists thought nothing could escape from a black hole because of the immense gravity,  but Hawking showed that,  theoretically,  some kind of particle could.","But his fame wasn't just a result of his research. Hawking,  who suffered from a debilitating neurological disease that made it impossible for him to move his limbs or speak,  was also a popular public figure and best-selling author. Additionally,  Hawking's sense of humor,  along with his fame,  allowed him to land some pretty unusual gigs for a physicist. He appeared on The Simpsons several times,  as well as Star Trek and The Big Bang Theory.","In one episode of The Simpsons,  Hawking showed a willingness to poke fun at himself â€” and,  in a way,  the entire culture of science.","\"Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing,  Homer, \" Hawking tells Homer Simpson. \"I may have to steal it.\""]}
