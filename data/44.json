His early work on black holes transformed how scientists think about the nature of the universe. Before him,  physicists thought nothing could escape from a black hole because of the immense gravity,  but Hawking showed that,  theoretically,  some kind of particle could.","frames":[23960,45460],"images":[]},{"text":"But his fame wasn't just a result of his research. Hawking,  who suffered from a debilitating neurological disease that made it impossible for him to move his limbs or speak,  was also a popular public figure and best-selling author. Additionally,  Hawking's sense of humor,  along with his fame,  allowed him to land some pretty unusual gigs for a physicist. He appeared on The Simpsons several times,  as well as Star Trek and The Big Bang Theory.","frames":[45980,77000],"images":[]},{"text":"In one episode of The Simpsons,  Hawking showed a willingness to poke fun at himself — and,  in a way,  the entire culture of science.","frames":[77700,87680],"images":[]},{"text":"\"Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing,  Homer, \" Hawking tells Homer Simpson. \"I may have to steal it.\"","frames":[88240,96600],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1521101597194-rc-upload-1521101478858-13.png","id":44}
