Blade II (2002) This sequel to 1998’s Blade was directed by Guillermo del Toro with a swirling,  demonic energy. The story once again concerns the charismatic daywalker,  played by Wesley Snipes. It is a delirious Gothic-tech martial arts movie and the fight sequences Del Toro unleashes are horribly exciting. Not a typical superhero film,  in many ways,  but a great one.","2. Black Panther (2018) This superb film is a deliriously entertaining Afrofuturist adventure,  with strange echoes of Rider Haggard. Black Panther was established as one of Marvel’s greatest heroes,  and Ryan Coogler’s movie showed that having a nearly non-white cast was not simply a matter of diversity signalling – it was a colossal box office hit across the board,  with a richer and more cultish element of fantasy than other Marvel films. (It also boasts MCU’s first woman cinematographer: the Oscar-nominated Rachel Morrison. Marvel Studios’ president,  Kevin Feige,  has promised to get more women writers and directors on board,  with next year’s Captain Marvel co-written and co-directed by Anna Boden. So far,  the only Marvel female writing credit is Nicole Perlman for Guardians Of The Galaxy.)","1. Thor: Ragnarok (2017) Somehow the Marvel planets came into alignment more perfectly,  more sublimely,  with this film than with any other Marvel movie: it is smart,  visually exciting and perhaps above all,  funny. And it’s funny in a way that only Marvel movies can be,  demonstrating that comedy need not undercut or send up the drama,  but that it can be an integral part of it. Taika Waititi was an inspired choice as director,  and Hemsworth and Cate Blanchett are tremendous as Thor and Hela,  the goddess of death who also happens to be Thor’s half-sister."]}
