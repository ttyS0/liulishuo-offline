Moreover,  research by the grassroots group Women for Independence revealed nearly one in five women had experienced period poverty.","The Scottish government said it worked closely with partners including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla),  Colleges Scotland,  Universities Scotland and the Scottish Funding Council on the scheme.","The communities secretary,  Aileen Campbell,  said: “I am proud that Scotland is taking this world-leading action to fight period poverty and I welcome the support of local authorities,  colleges and universities in implementing this initiative.”","Councillor Alison Evison,  the president of Cosla,  said while the primary aim of the scheme was to ensure no young person missed out on their education through a lack of access to sanitary products,  “it will also contribute to a more open conversation and reducing the unnecessary stigma associated with periods”."]}
