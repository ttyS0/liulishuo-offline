The exodus is broad and deep — an outflow of doctors,  engineers,  oil workers,  bus drivers and electricians.","So far this year,  48, 000 teachers — or 12 percent of all staff at elementary and high schools nationwide — have quit,  according to Se Educa,  an educational nonprofit group. The vast majority,  according to the group,  have joined a stampede of Venezuelans leaving the country to escape food lines and empty grocery store shelves.","During the first five months of the year,  roughly 400, 000 Venezuelans have fled the country,  following 1.8 million who left over the last two years,  according to the Central University of Venezuela. Yet even those numbers may not fully capture the scope of the exodus. Aid workers dealing with the crisis in bordering nations say an average of 4, 600 Venezuelans a day have been leaving since Jan. 1 — putting the outflow during this year alone at nearly 700, 000.","The Venezuelans are running from a nation broken by failed policies,  mismanagement,  corruption and lower global oil prices — the country's principal source of cash."]}
