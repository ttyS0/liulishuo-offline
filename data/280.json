It doesn't take a deep understanding of American anti-Semitism to know that to him,  \"our people\" did not include Jewish Americans,  even though Jews have lived in America since before the founding of the United States and the congregation he attacked has been convening to pray since the Civil War.","frames":[20800,57000]},{"images":[],"text":"Why,  then,  did this white-nationalist xenophobe gun down local Jews to protest HIAS?
