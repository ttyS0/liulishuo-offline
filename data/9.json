The two Koreas haven't competed under a single banner since 1991.","\"I'm sure it will be a very emotional moment,  not just for all Koreans,  but also for the entire world, \" said Thomas Bach,  the president of the International Olympic Committee,  who hailed the agreement as being in the \"true Olympic spirit of respect and friendship.\"","Easing tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula can relieve the so-called \"Korea discount, \" a term often used to describe the phenomenon of Korea stocks and sovereign credit being undervalued due to the unique situation Korea faces,  said presidential office spokesman Yoon Young-chan in a statement. \"North Korea's Olympic participation is an investment for the future, \" he said."]}
