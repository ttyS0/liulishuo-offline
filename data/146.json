That has left cable,  telecoms and tech giants urgently searching for premier content they can control,  which would make them more immune to shifting technologies. Beyond  AT&T and Comcast,  Apple,  Google and Amazon have all moved into producing or buying original programming.","\"For Comcast,  this is a must-win, \" BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield told The Post. \"It's the most landlocked company out there. Fox is its only real shot for it to become a global company.\"","Fox has given no hint of where it was leaning. In a statement Wednesday,  the company said it \"has not yet made a determination,  in light of Comcast's proposal,  as to whether it will postpone or adjourn the July 10,  2018 special meeting of stockholders to consider certain proposals related to the Disney Merger Agreement.\" Disney did not respond to a request for comment."]}
