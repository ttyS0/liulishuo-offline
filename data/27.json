But 5G will be offering speeds from hundreds of megabits per second up to gigabits,  or 1, 000 megabits,  per second.","5G latency will be so low that you'll have near-instantaneous reaction times to requests. And that will prove important for applications like self-driving cars. By adding 5G connections to such vehicles,  self-driving cars will be able to send and receive information fast enough to avoid accidents with other autonomous vehicles.","You've likely noticed what happens when bandwidth becomes congested. If you've ever been at a coffee shop or hotel with a large number of people,  your Internet connection becomes almost unusable due to the amount of traffic. With 5G,   bandwidth will grow to a degree that thousands of individual devices will be able to connect to cell towers at once without issue."]}
