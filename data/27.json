But 5G will be offering speeds from hundreds of megabits per second up to gigabits,  or 1, 000 megabits,  per second.","frames":[30870,45750],"images":[]},{"text":"5G latency will be so low that you'll have near-instantaneous reaction times to requests. And that will prove important for applications like self-driving cars. By adding 5G connections to such vehicles,  self-driving cars will be able to send and receive information fast enough to avoid accidents with other autonomous vehicles.","frames":[46570,67970],"images":[]},{"text":"You've likely noticed what happens when bandwidth becomes congested. If you've ever been at a coffee shop or hotel with a large number of people,  your Internet connection becomes almost unusable due to the amount of traffic. With 5G,   bandwidth will grow to a degree that thousands of individual devices will be able to connect to cell towers at once without issue.","frames":[68700,90620],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1519640658068-rc-upload-1519625430892-6.png","id":27}
