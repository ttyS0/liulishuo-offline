{"title":"Tennis: more glory beckons for ageless Federer","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/1518000239256-rc-upload-1517997390951-10.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1518000196515-rc-upload-1517997390951-4.png","contents":["Without a grand slam title from the middle of 2012 to the conclusion of  2016,  Roger Federer has now won three of his last four following a gripping victory over Marin Cilic in Sunday's Australian Open final.","The 36-year-old Swiss marvel continues to defy the years and attrition rate to reach his sixth Australian crown. Meanwhile,  his long-time rivals have fallen by the wayside and are struggling to get their careers back on track.","Federer has reached the milestone of 20 grand slam titles -- the first man to do so -- and it is a mark that could stand for decades. Or longer. The one prize that eludes him is an Olympic singles gold medal â€“ and that might be incentive enough for him to qualify for Tokyo by returning to playing Davis Cup for his country.","Asked how he continues to thrive at the top of such a competitive sport,  Federer paid tribute to his wife and parents,  adding: \"I've just got to keep a good schedule,  stay hungry,  then maybe good things can happen. Then I don't think age is an issue,  per se. It's just a number.\""]}
