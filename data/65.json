{"title":"Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and Defiance of Prince Charles","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1522824639077-516.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1522828442056-52.png","contents":["While Prince Charles's relationship with his parents was set in a permanent frost,  his connection with his sons was almost as uneasy. One of his most painful recollections was of a visit to Kensington Palace while Diana was alive,  and the boys were still small. As soon as Harry saw his father,  he ran towards him — then suddenly stopped short.","'Mummy says I mustn't, ' he cried,  just as Charles was about to hug him.","There was only one conclusion to be drawn: Diana had poisoned the boys' minds towards their father.","After her death,  the brothers had to cope with a continuing onslaught of public revelations about their parents' adulterous relationships. Grieving for his mother,  William would say,  was especially difficult because 'it was so raw',  and there was minimal privacy.","And then there was Camilla. Charles's relationship with his sons certainly wasn't helped by her presence — which was a constant reminder of their mother's torment.","In the opinion of some of his staff,  Charles's lifestyle had blinded him to his sons' personal troubles,  and he was largely unaware of their coolness towards his mistress."]}
