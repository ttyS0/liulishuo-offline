It has been eagerly anticipated: many have taken to Twitter to share #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe; a video of children at a school in Atlanta reacting to news of a trip to see the flick has gone viral.","But while its diversity and originality have drawn widespread praise from fans and critics alike,  some have been less kind. A campaign on Facebook to \"give 'Black Panther' a rotten audience score on Rotten Tomatoes\",  a review aggregator,  was taken down by the social-media site for violating \"community standards\". It has not stopped \"Black Panther\" from breaking records even before its release,  with more presales than any other superhero movie. It enjoys a 98% \"fresh\" rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes,  too."]}
