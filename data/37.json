But like every other trade,  it is having to contend with automation.","Now fortune-telling apps for smartphones are beguiling city kids. Proffer your palm to the camera or snap a selfie,  and another app provides instant face- and palm-reading.","If computers could process and dissect what contributes to human intuition,  might they become the fortune-tellers of the future? Already,  robots are being taught how to read the future. For many,  this portends a rather fearsome future. But a pair of South Korean artists at LOVOT LAB offer a different vision.","In the corner of their studio,  a small white robot sits cross-legged. \"Buddha I\" has been programmed to read faces to detect a few basic emotions,  and dispenses lighthearted prophecies accordingly. Mr Hong of LOVOT LAB was struck by how many go to have their fortunes read even as they laugh it all off.","The robo-Buddha stirs from its slumber. \"You look happy today, \" it purrs. \"Good things will come to you.\""]}
