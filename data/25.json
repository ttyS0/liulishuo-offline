Zooming in on those areas brings into focus the locations and outlines of known U.S. military bases,  as well as of other unknown and potentially sensitive sites — presumably because American soldiers and other personnel are using fitness trackers as they move around.","Strava issued a statement overnight saying that it is \"committed to working with military and government officials to address sensitive areas that might appear.\" An earlier company statement had urged its subscribers to check their privacy settings and provided a link to a site that explained how to do that."]}
