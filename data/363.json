Shares in the production company behind the show,  Entertainment One,  rallied the most in about four months in London trading.","It’s a remarkable change in fortunes for television’s most famous hog. In May last year,  Peppa Pig morphed into a symbol when its popularity on online platforms saw it associated with “shehuiren”—a slang word spurring grown-up fans to link the show to rap music,  while some even got tattoos of the character.","The movie teaser released Thursday,  in the lead up to the Chinese New Year holiday,  shows a rural man’s attempt to discover what his city-raised granddaughter means when she says “Pei Qi\" —“Peppa Pig” in Chinese. After a failed attempt to paint a farm pig red,  he adapts an old ventilation fan to make it look like the character,  pleasing the awaiting child.","After stocks tied to Peppa soared in Asia overnight,  sentiment around Entertainment One shares was given a further boost when U.K. toymaker Character Group Plc highlighted the brand’s strength in a trading update. Entertainment One rose 5.2 percent on Friday,  the most since Sept. 27."]}
