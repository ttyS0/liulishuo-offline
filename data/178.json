In addition,  90% of men said that they were ready to split the cost of the wedding â€“ a dramatic departure from the traditional attitude that the bride's family should pay for everything.","The findings appear at odds with the more conservative attitudes common in India about marriage,  the role of wives,  the privileges and entitlements accorded to men,  and the importance of marrying someone of the same caste.","Hitesh Dhingra,  co-founder of dating app TrulyMadly,  believes there are two reasons for the enlightened views expressed in the survey. One is that young Indians,  as users of the internet and social media,  are exposed to new ideas that challenge traditional social mores. The other is that,  as more millennials choose their partners using dating apps and websites,  they are more likely to focus on personality and compatibility than caste and religion.","\"What we are seeing are the markers of a new generation that has been shaped by the internet and influenced by attitudes and behaviour they see in developed countries, \" said Azhar Iqbal,  CEO of Inshorts."]}
