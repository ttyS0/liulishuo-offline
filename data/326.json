{"title":"‘Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse’: A Fresh Take on a Venerable Hero","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1545372854076-10.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1545372854076-8.jpg","contents":["“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” contains a vital element that has been missing from too many recent superhero movies: fun. This animated reworking of the Spidey mythos is fresh and exhilarating in a way that very few of its live-action counterparts — including the last couple of “Spider-Man” chapters — have been. Its jaunty,  brightly colored inventiveness and its kid-in-the-candy-store appetite for pop culture ephemera give “Into the Spider-Verse” some of the kick of the first “Lego Movie.”","And,  as I was saying,  a lot of fun. The story is clever and just complicated enough,  moving quickly through silly bits,  pausing for moments of heart-tugging sentiment,  and losing itself in wild creative mischief. It is referential (and reverential) enough to Marvel traditions to please the geek armies,  and perfectly accessible to new recruits or part-time warriors.","It finds realism,  too. This may be the first “Spider-Man” feature to qualify as a great New York movie,  drawn from the life of the city rather than outdated stereotypes. Streets and subways,  apartments and schoolyards are beautifully and faithfully drawn,  as are humans of all ages,  shapes and hues. The people talk fast,  the music is loud and sometimes hectic,  and everyone is in motion all the time. Even the tourists from other universes are sorry to leave."]}
