Think again—a new study from the University of Buffalo found that less than ten percent of Twitter users expressed doubt when responding to a false tweet.","The study,  published on May 11 in the journal Natural Hazards,  examined Twitter's response to four different rumors during two disasters—the Boston Marathon Bombing and Hurricane Sandy—by examining 20, 000 related tweets.","Only between one to nine percent of the Twitter users that responded to the false rumors expressed doubt at the accuracy of the information. The largest group instead helped spread the misinformation — between 86 and 91 percent of the users in the study retweeted or liked the original post.","The researchers also looked at what happened when the rumors were proven false,  and found that less than 10 percent went back to delete their tweet and less than 20 percent shared the debunking in a new tweet.","Because the study only looked at tweets,  retweets,  comments and likes,  the group couldn't determine how many users didn't interact with the rumor,  noting that ignoring the tweet could also be a response from users that doubted the accuracy of the information."]}
