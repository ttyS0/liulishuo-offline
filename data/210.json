The boy also shared details of his hacking with members of a WhatsApp group.","Apple would not specify to Guardian Australia what information had been accessed by the boy,  or how they identified the breach.","The boy pleaded guilty and will return to the court for sentencing in September.","Dr Suelette Dreyfus,  a privacy expert from the University of Melbourne’s school of computing and information systems,  urged against a punitive sentence.","“I have researched a number of teen hacker cases internationally, ” Dreyfus said.","“Young people often make mistakes when they are exploring and rule-breaking especially online – including boasting about their exploits. It’s not right,  but for tech teens,  it can be a part of growing up ... there’s usually a really worried teen and family at the end of this sort of court case.”"]}
