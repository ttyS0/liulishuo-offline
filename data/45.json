Of his 147 predictions since the 1990s,  he claims an 86 percent accuracy rate. Recently he has made yet another prediction: the technological singularity will happen sometime in the next 30 years.","The singularity is that point in time when all the advances in technology,  particularly in artificial intelligence (AI),  will lead to machines that are smarter than human beings.","We all know it is coming sooner or later,  but the question in the minds of almost everyone is: should humanity fear the singularity? Everyone knows that when machines become smarter than human beings,  they tend to take over the world. Many of the world's science and technology bigwigs — like Stephen Hawking,  Elon Musk,  and even Bill Gates — warn about this kind of future.","Well,  Kurzweil doesn't think so. In fact,  it would be more accurate to say that he's been looking forward to it. For him,  the singularity is an opportunity for humankind to improve. He envisions the same technology that will make AIs more intelligent giving humans a boost as well. He thinks the future will be an unparalleled human-machine synthesis. \"We're going to be able to meet the physical needs of all humans,  expand our minds and exemplify these artistic qualities that we value.\""]}
