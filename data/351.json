Adam Breeden,  an entrepreneur who has developed concepts based on darts,  ping pong,  golf and,  next year,  bingo,  said the willingness of people to choose games for a night out,  rather than supposedly cooler dance music,  showed that the young generation had the confidence to pursue what it really wants.","Meanwhile,  festivals,  dating websites and social networking have undermined one of clubbing’s unique selling points: a chance to find romance.","The figures are stark: 11% of adults went to nightclubs at least once a month in the year to September,  down from 15% two years earlier,  according to Mintel,  a market research company. It estimates there has been a 17% drop in the value of the clubbing market since 2013.","The founder of Warehouse Project in Manchester,  Sacha Lord said: “The 18- to 23-year-olds that are coming through now are into what they’re wearing,  how they look,  what they eat,  and that’s down to the explosion of social media. Instagram is all about everybody wants the perfect look,  everybody wants to be seen at the right places. Whereas a few years ago,  when the kids were all out binge drinking. Nobody wants that any more now—everybody wants to portray this amazing,  perfect life.”"]}
