In 2013,  he took four prison guards hostage while using plastic explosives to blast his way through five sets of prison doors. Faïd was recaptured several weeks later.","On this occasion,  Faïd was in the prison visitors’ room when three armed men clad in black landed a small helicopter in the facility's central courtyard. Two of the men ran inside,  used a grinding machine to cut through the doors to the visiting area and,  with Faïd in tow,  raced back to the helicopter.","Faïd,  who grew up in the poor outskirts of Paris,  was known in the 1990s for being part of a ring of thieves who specialized in robbing armored vans used to transport money and other valuables. He served 10 years of a 20-year sentence before being released on good behavior. On emerging from prison then,  he wrote an autobiography,  “Gangster: From the Slums to Big Crime.” The book's blurb on the French Amazon website describes him as being a long way from the petty thieves of the slums and instead one of the “criminal aristocracy.”"]}
