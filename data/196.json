But that doesn't mean they like it.","Now a growing number of them identify with a Finnish cartoon character who channels their urban anxieties,  albeit in a different cultural context.","The “Finnish Nightmares” comic series documents the social challenges faced by Matti,  a mild-mannered stick figure who abhors small talk. The series has been trending on Chinese social media,  and it even spawned a new word for social awkwardness in Mandarin: jingfen,  or “spiritually Finnish.”","Matti is a “stereotypical Finn” who “tries his best to do unto others as he wishes to be done unto him: to give space,  be polite and not bother with unnecessary chitchat, ” according to a description on the official website of “Finnish Nightmares.”","“As an anthropophobic,  I love this series so much, ” Li Xin,  a college student in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen,  wrote recently on Sina Weibo,  one of China's most popular social media sites,  where a “Finnish Nightmares” hashtag has gotten about 240, 000 clicks.","“China has a huge population,  and Chinese people usually congregate in large groups,  but there are still a lot of introverts,  like me, ” Ms. Li,  22,  said in an interview conducted via Weibo messages. “In a society like China's,  we are considered hard to deal with and thought of as weirdos. But the truth is we just don't enjoy unnecessary socializing that much. It’s too tiring.”"]}
