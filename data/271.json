With a B.","All eyes were on the latest drawing Friday night,  when the jackpot was at an already mind-boggling $1 billion. However,  with no ticket matching all six numbers drawn - 15,  23,  53,  65,  70 and Mega Ball 7 - the grand prize now swells to $1.6 billion.","The next drawing is at 11 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday.","\"Mega Millions has already entered historic territory,  but it's truly astounding to think that now the jackpot has reached an all-time world record, \" Gordon Medenica,  lead director of the Mega Millions Group and director of Maryland Lottery and Gaming,  said in a statement. \"It's hard to overstate how exciting this is - but now it's really getting fun.\"","Medenica told The Post that about 57 percent of the possible number combinations were purchased in advance of Friday's drawing and that it was an \"extremely pleasant surprise\" there was no winner.","\"That means the odds were [a winning ticket] would have gotten picked but it didn't, \" Medenica said. \"This is really uncharted territory for all of us.\"","What's more,  the jackpot is likely to grow even larger before Tuesday,  as word of the record-breaking grand prize grows and prompts even people who don't normally play the lottery to buy a ticket,  Medenica said.","The estimated cash option for a $1.6 billion jackpot - should a winner choose to take a one-time lump sum payment instead of annual payouts over 30 years - is about $905 million,  according to Mega Millions officials."]}
