While there are those who get a charge out of keeping others waiting,  the majority of us late people hate being late as well.","Being consistently late might not be your fault. It could be your type. The punctually-challenged often share personality characteristics such as optimism,  low levels of self-control,  anxiety,  or a penchant for thrill-seeking. Personality differences could also dictate how we experience the passing of time.","But there are other reasons for lateness as well. For starters,  there's the anticipation of being late,  or too much attention to detail. If you have a report you must finish by a specific deadline,  the constant worrying about the deadline,  or the fear for writing a sub-par report might just get the better of you.","For others,  lateness is a consequence of deeply distressing common mental health or neurological conditions. For instance,  people with anxiety diagnoses often avoid certain situations. Individuals with low self-esteem are likely to be critical about their abilities which may cause them to take more time to check their work.","So the next time you see someone late,  just know that lateness may just be part of their charm."]}
