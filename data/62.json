Issued earlier this week,  the patent may help Amazon solve the problem of how flying robots might interact with customers waiting on their doorsteps.","Depending on a person's gestures — a welcoming thumbs up,  shouting or frantic arm waving — the drone can adjust its behavior,  according to the patent. The machine could release the package it's carrying,  alter its flight path to avoid crashing,  ask humans a question or end the delivery,  the patent says.","Since announcing its plans to develop an air delivery service,  Amazon has applied for several ambitious patents that include designs for drones that self-destruct during an emergency. However,  there's no word on when the gesture-recognition system might debut. Amazon declined to comment. In 2016,  the company made its first autonomous drone delivery to a shopper in the United Kingdom. A private customer trial for drone delivery in Britain is ongoing."]}
