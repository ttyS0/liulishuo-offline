However,  there's no word on when the gesture-recognition system might debut. Amazon declined to comment. In 2016,  the company made its first autonomous drone delivery to a shopper in the United Kingdom. A private customer trial for drone delivery in Britain is ongoing.","frames":[61940,93420],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1522667721770-rc-upload-1522667576272-12.png","id":62}
