However,  Billboard reports that Spotify has been quietly enforcing a version of the new \"Hate Content and Hateful Conduct policy\" for \"the last several years\" without publicising it.","And Don Gorder,  the chairman of the management department at Berklee College of Music,  called Spotify's decision \"a big deal\" given the influence of its playlists,  but warned that \"it is a slippery slope.\" Spotify \"created this new moral standard – what is it?\" he asked. \"Where is the line?\"","Spotify has already acknowledged that it is treading in seriously murky waters and said in its announcement that it needed time to evolve. At present,  Spotify risks making more of a mess than the one it is trying to clear up."]}
