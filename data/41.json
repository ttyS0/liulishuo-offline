{"title":"Why Jessie J’s bid to win a Chinese talent show is the best career move she’s ever made","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/1520906137795-rc-upload-1520906132172-8.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1520847089003-rc-upload-1520846922089-4.png","contents":["Jessie J's career launched with the video Do It Like a Dude. That song went platinum,  as did her debut album. J quickly transformed into a household name. But then things started to go wrong. Her second album was a relative flop and the press turned on her for being too full of herself. Even though Bang Bang,  her collaboration with Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj,  became a huge hit,   J's career stalled.","But now,  Jessie J has found a pop playing field where she can't come last: appearing on Chinese singing competition Singer,  not as a judge but as a contestant. The show sees singers who have already had music industry experience compete to stay for another week.","On the show – which she signed up to because \"there's nothing I can't do\" – Jessie J has finally received the critical adulation she desires. Her performances have received superlative comments from the judges.","She is not the only star who,  after struggling with negative press attention,  has gone niche to find a more welcoming community who will celebrate them when others won't. By going on a show that is all about the singing and not about actually being a charismatic pop star,  she has finally found a place where she can be smothered in praise."]}
