It's currently being towed to Murmansk,  a port town in northwest Russia,  where it will be loaded up with fuel; its destination is a town in the Arctic Circle called Pevek,  where it will begin generating power in the Summer of 2019,  according to The Independent.","frames":[5180,32780],"images":[]},{"text":"The power plant has no propulsion of its own,  but is being towed up North to avoid the steep cost of shipping it by land piece by piece to remote areas.
