It's currently being towed to Murmansk,  a port town in northwest Russia,  where it will be loaded up with fuel; its destination is a town in the Arctic Circle called Pevek,  where it will begin generating power in the Summer of 2019,  according to The Independent.","The power plant has no propulsion of its own,  but is being towed up North to avoid the steep cost of shipping it by land piece by piece to remote areas. Once it's there,  it will provide electricity to a town of 100, 000 people.","Rosatom,  the government-owned Russian energy company that developed the Lomonosov,  released a statement saying that the floating reactor will be \"invincible\" to tsunamis and other natural disasters,  and that it has met all the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency.","The stakes are high,  and surely Rosatom has every incentive to get this right — should something go wrong,  years of expensive planning and testing go down the toilet,  along with any fossil fuel mining operations that the plant would have powered."]}
