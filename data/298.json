{"title":"Get comfy! How curling up on the sofa became the height of fashion ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1542958366170-24.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1542956448466-8.jpg","contents":["The onset of winter is enough to make even the most sociable of us want nothing more after work than a simple formula: sofa,  sweatpants,  and a series on the laptop. Guess what? That is not a cop-out this year. Sofa dressing is the off-duty look for 2018.","The fashion site Man Repeller calls it “sleepleisure” and is in favour of it. So is the retailer Farfetch. “It’s a reflection of a big shift towards comfort, ” says Celenie Seidel,  Farfetch’s market editor. You could also credit Kendall Jenner and Rihanna,  with their XXXXL hoodies,  and Hailey Baldwin in a tracksuit at the airport.","The move to reclaim comfort clothes for outside the home has been underway for ages. But now it is the clothes you reserve for a night in front of the box that are in the frame. You know the kind – the big T-shirt you have had for ages,  teamed with leggings. The grey trackies and matching hoodie. The comfy nightdress you change into way before bedtime.","This trend presents as the opposite of the perfectly tasteful,  definitely-very-expensive loungewear of your best life as presented on Instagram. There is no need for perfectly groomed hair and makeup here. Instead,  this is a situation for a topknot,  no makeup,  and a jade roller to hand.","Right now,  considering what you wear around only your inner circle feels more modern than dressing to impress strangers in a bar – and,  let’s be honest,  Instagram sneaks in here. Thanks to the bathroom selfie and #iwokeuplikethis humblebrags,  nowhere is off-limits from the feed. As Man Repeller puts it: “Innerwear is outerwear because what we do inside is no longer private.”"]}
