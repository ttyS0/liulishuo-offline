{"title":"Video game addiction is a real condition, WHO says","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1530176173136-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1530176173136-4.jpg","contents":["The World Health Organization on Monday officially recognized \"gaming disorder\" as a condition in its International Classification of Diseases,  saying that it is possible to be addicted to video games.","Simply playing a lot of video games does not automatically mean that someone has a problem. The hallmark of the disorder is that playing games overtakes other desires,  and that it continues or escalates despite negative consequences. A diagnosis would have to include evidence of this type of behavior lasting for more than 12 months,  the organization said.","The disorder affects no more than 3 percent of gamers,  the Associated Press reported,  with some estimates as low as one percent. More than 2 billion people worldwide regularly play games.","Not everyone agrees with the WHO that defining this condition will help patients. The U.S. video game industry threw its support behind several academics who opposed the WHO's efforts when it confirmed last year that they would include \"gaming disorder\" as a condition. Clinicians have also debated the validity of establishing a gaming disorder,  as it shares many characteristics with other addictive disorders."]}
