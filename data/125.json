His body was found floating in the East River about 9 miles south,  near the Brooklyn Bridge,  on Wednesday. Friends and family members believe Chow jumped to his death,  adding to a string of apparent suicides of traditional taxi and livery drivers in the city. It marked the fifth suicide in just over five months.","New York City's cab industry,  dependent on the market value of the once-coveted taxi medallion,  has been upended by the proliferation of Uber and other services. Drivers have been demanding changes at City Hall to protect their livelihood,  but at least five cabbies have buckled under the strain of debt since December as others describe working 12- and 14-hour shifts to make up for the lost income. One driver shot himself in February outside City Hall after leaving a message on Facebook blaming the industry's demise on politicians.","The medallion system was created to limit the number of cabdrivers,  but apps like Uber have rendered it useless,  said Desai,  executive director of the New York City Taxi Workers Alliance. Last year,  data showed that more people used Uber than yellow cabs in the city. Once sold for more than $1 million,  taxi medallions are now selling for as little as $175, 000,  according to data collected by the Taxi and Limousine Commission."]}
