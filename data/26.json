John suffers from dementia and Ella has sudden headaches that bode no good. But their love is so strong that rather than live separated in different medical facilities,  they decide to take a last road trip together. Virzi takes them down the East Coast to Hemingway's house in Key West. This destination makes quite a beautiful route that gives John plenty time to recite prose and poetry.","But all being said,  award-winning Virzi apparently has left his usual witty originality at home. A road movie short on comedy and drama should at least offer a keen level of observation,  but here insight is scarce and emotional resonance is faint,  suggesting the project was not a good match for the director's talents."]}
