And his last words were: 'This is taking an awfully long time!'","Though Goodall was not terminally ill,  he had seen his eyesight and mobility deteriorate considerably in recent years and said that his life stopped being enjoyable \"five or ten years ago\".","The scientist requested that his body be donated to medicine or,  if that were not possible,  that his ashes be scattered locally in Switzerland."]}
