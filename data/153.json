{"title":"'New Zealand wants you': the problem with tech at the edge of the world","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1530613847947-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1530613847947-4.jpg","contents":["At the end of 2017,  an unusual job advertisement appeared in New Zealand. Responsibilities included planning for future workforce needs,  responding to “emerging and disruptive technologies” and improving digital access. The salary was $400, 000.","The advert wasn't placed by a Silicon Valley tech giant,  but the government seeking the nation's first ever “chief technology officer”.","The creation of the CTO role and a new “global impact visa” specifically to lure entrepreneurs,  investors and tech start-ups are key parts of that push.","“If you want to make a positive global impact, ” pleads a video for the government's global impact visa. “New Zealand wants you.”","Despite the bold talk – including the slogan “this is the place of the possible” – investment still lags astronomically far behind the two biggest earners of agriculture and tourism.","However,  that might be about to change. Green MP Gareth Hughes recently told the Spinoff: “There is a limit to how many tourists we can cram into Fiordland with the infrastructure. There is a limit to how many cows we can have in our paddocks,  and we are seeing that in the state of our waterways. There is no limit to the export of software,  services and intellectual property in creative industries.”"]}
