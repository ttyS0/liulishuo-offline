Bowls brimming with tapioca balls bathed in lightly sweetened syrup. Take a bite of any of these dishes and you’ll discover a unique texture. But how exactly do you describe that perfectly calibrated “mouth feel”? Slippery? Chewy? Globby? Not exactly the most flattering adjectives in the culinary world.","Luckily,  the Taiwanese have a word for this texture. Well,  actually,  it’s not a word,  it’s a letter—one that even non-Chinese speakers can pronounce. It’s “Q.”","“It’s difficult to explain what Q means exactly, ” said Liu Yen-ling,  a manager at Chun Shui Tang,  a popular teahouse chain that claims to have invented tapioca milk tea in Taiwan. “Basically it means springy,  soft,  elastic.”","Q texture is to Taiwanese what umami is to Japanese and al dente is to Italians—that is,  cherished and essential.
