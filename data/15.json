{"title":"Hugh Jackman puts on a show in cheesy, charming musical: The Greatest Showman ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/1517641966610-rc-upload-1517641683851-8.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1517641831878-rc-upload-1517641683851-4.png","contents":["It's a movie which in some ways resembles Moulin Rouge from 2001: a celebratory and euphoric entertainment which is not overly concerned with dramatic or psychological consistency. It is all about the mood,  the feel,  the general sugar rush of euphoria.","The film succeeds in being cheesy and sugary at the same time,  and is very loosely based on the life of the legendary showman Phineas T. Barnum,  the man who in the 19th century possibly invented entertainment as we know it today.","And Hugh Jackman is absolutely the right casting for this figure. At any rate,  Jackman gives this the muscular heft that it needs. He has the musical theater chops and the film pizzazz to sell it; he is approachably handsome and his singing voice is light,  pleasant,  yet strong and competent. It's not a film to break molds or test boundaries. Yet Jackman's real charm will carry you along."]}
