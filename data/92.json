The US president is known to have a strong hand shake that he uses to try and let people he's meeting know that he's more dominant than him.","However,  he seemed a little disarmed when Macron went for a more European pair of pecks on the cheeks as he arrived at the White House. It is the first state visit of Trump's presidency and follows their romantic time together with a lavish dinner at the Eiffel Tower last summer.","The French and American presidents walked in step as they approached George Washington's historic Mount Vernon mansion overlooking the Potomac River,  their wives following as a harpist serenaded the glamorous double date. The Macrons joined the Trumps for the outing to the Mount Vernon estate after the French president and his wife Brigitte visited the White House,  where the world leaders appeared cheerful despite differing on many issues in recent months. Wielding golden shovels,  the leaders together planted an oak sapling from Macron as a testament of Franco-American friendship. Later in the evening the foursome boarded the US leader's Marine One helicopter that whisked them to Mount Vernon for a private dinner.","Following the two-hour meal the couples reboarded the roaring helicopter to embark on the rest of the three-day state visit. The two men have an unlikely friendship,  despite strong differences on areas such as climate change."]}
