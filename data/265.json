{"title":"Face time: is makeup for men the next big beauty trend? ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1540189001031-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1540189001031-16.jpg","contents":["For the last century,  makeup has been mostly the preserve of just half the population. Even as society has become more feminist,  and less ruled by gender binaries,  women’s cosmetics use has become even more prolific,  while men have continued to go au naturel,  occasionally boshing on a bit of moisturiser and hoping for the best. But that may be changing,  as brands from Chanel to Tom Ford launch male cosmetics lines.","Tom Ford launched a men’s concealer and brow gel comb last year; Chanel now has a tinted foundation,  a matte lip balm and four shades of eyebrow pencil under its new Boy De Chanel brand. Male cosmetics still make up less than 1% of the $465bn global beauty market,  although 15% of UK men under 45 bought makeup in 2016.","As with the boom in female beauty,  the charge is being led by ordinary teenagers making videos in their bedrooms. James Charles from upstate New York was 16 when he launched his first makeup tutorial on YouTube. By the age of 18,  Charles had amassed 8.5 million subscribers and become the first man to model for makeup brand CoverGirl.","In the UK,  the most famous male beauty vlogger is Gary Thompson,  who has had campaigns with L’Oréal and Superdrug. He started wearing makeup because of bad skin,  but now loves the way it makes him feel.","Both Thompson and Charles are model-like,  and their makeup looks are full-on and feminine: lots of contouring,  bronzer and colour. Both are gay; queer culture has always appropriated elements of femininity,  particularly makeup. As Thompson says,  “Makeup connects with queer culture—it’s such a powerful form of expression.”"]}
