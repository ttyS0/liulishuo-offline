Even as society has become more feminist,  and less ruled by gender binaries,  women’s cosmetics use has become even more prolific,  while men have continued to go au naturel,  occasionally boshing on a bit of moisturiser and hoping for the best.

As Thompson says,  “Makeup connects with queer culture—it’s such a powerful form of expression.”","frames":[97410,118580]},{"images":[],"text":"","frames":[118580,123580]}],"author":"10.24 男性化妆Daniel","shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1540189001031-18.jpg","id":265,"posterUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1540189001031-16.jpg","duration":119145,"url":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1540189001031-6.mp3","engTitle":"Face time: is makeup for men the next big beauty trend?
