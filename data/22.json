The move is a response to studies that suggest lobsters are sentient with advanced nervous systems that may feel pain.","From March 2018,  lobsters being prepared in Switzerland will need to be knocked out before they're put to death,  or killed instantly. They'll also get other protections while in transit.","\"It's a positive move,  the Swiss are looking at a potential problem and trying to deal with it, \" Robert Elwood,  a professor of animal behavior at the Queen's University Belfast,  told CNN. \"We give protections to birds and animals,  currently we give very little protection to decapod crustaceans — lobsters and crabs — and the question comes,  why is there a difference?\""]}
