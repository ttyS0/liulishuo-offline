But the North's recent declarations that it would at least talk about denuclearization certainly do look like significant concessions.","frames":[4620,23320],"images":[]},{"text":"Only a year ago,  the Kim regime had reasons to be happy. In 2017,  it tested two long-range missile prototypes capable of hitting the continental United States with a nuclear warhead,  and also exploded its first hydrogen bomb. But Kim soon found himself contending with a rather unconventional U.S. president,  who promised to use armed force if the North Koreans did not agree to abandon their nuclear program.","frames":[23860,54020],"images":[]},{"text":"Trump's threats also persuaded China to support the toughest-ever sanctions against North Korea,  making it near-impossible for it to sell anything on the international market.

Then,  they will ensure that these stages will be numerous and prolonged,  thus winning time in hopes that sooner or later the White House will have a more conventional inhabitant.","frames":[80760,105720],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1524911633716-35.png","id":89}
