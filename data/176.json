At a news conference,  he is asked about the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States.","\"I fear that this has become a bad relationship — a relationship based on the president taking exactly what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to,  um,  Britain, \" he says in the movie.","\"We may be a small country,  but we're a great one too, \" he adds,  to a soundtrack of soaring strings. \"A friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength,  from now onward I should be prepared to be much stronger. And the president should be prepared for that.\"","May,  who hosted Trump at a dinner Thursday and was meeting with him at the country estate Chequers on Friday,  showed no sign of planning a confrontation. But at least one prominent supporter of the opposition leader,  Jeremy Corbyn,  said that he would have done so: \"If we'd elected Jeremy Corbyn last year,  we'd be getting our Love Actually moment right now, \" Kerry-Anne Mendoza wrote on Twitter. \"Instead,  Trump baby is getting his ego fondled by Theresa the Appeaser. We may get a do-over soon. Don't make the same mistake twice Britain.\""]}
