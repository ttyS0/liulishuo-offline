She felt it was important to \"come out of the basement\" to celebrate the host's 60th birthday.","She then joked about their new normal life,  including her being able to answer the door herself and former President Obama complaining he got \"shortchanged, \" because he \"doesn't have enough closet space, \" while their daughter,  Sasha,  occupies a \"two-room suite.\"","Though the conversation was light,  Ellen took a moment to discuss how \"frightened\" she feels amid the current political climate.","\"The thing that we have to remember — the thing I learned in the eight years I was in the White House — was that what we do every day in our lives,  the good things that we do every day,  we show empathy,  we care for each other,  you know,  we do have a lot in common. That's what it means to lead with hope and not fear. And that all we have is hope.\""]}
