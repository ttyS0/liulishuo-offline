{"title":"The Academy announces a misguided new category","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1534842602713-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1534842602713-4.jpg","contents":["The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on August 8th that it will be introducing a new category in time for next February’s awards ceremony,  one that honours “achievement in popular film”.","The idea is that,  alongside the time-honoured “Best Picture” category,  there will be another for films which have a broader appeal: blockbusters,  in other words.","Ironically,  the announcement has been anything but popular.","On social media,  responses to this idea have ranged from hostile to very hostile indeed.","Many feel that the once-prestigious Oscars are dumbing down to the level of the MTV Awards.","What’s next—Best Kiss? Loudest Shoot-Out? Most Skyscrapers Flattened by Aliens in a Single Action Sequence?","The concept of the “Hit Oscar” or the “Popcorn Oscar”,  as it has been nicknamed,  raises other questions,  too.","To start with,  who decides whether or not a film is popular? What are the criteria or thresholds?","And isn’t it an insult to nominees,  the implicit suggestion being that hit films can’t be artistic (and vice versa)?","There was a time when the likes of “Braveheart”,  “Titanic” and “Gladiator” could make zillions at the box office,  while also scooping up armfuls of golden statuettes.","But in the past decade the top Oscar has gone to auteur projects such as “The Shape of Water”,  “Moonlight” and “Birdman”: terrific films,  but by no means the so-called “tentpoles” that keep a roof over the studios’ heads.","The new division between best picture and popular picture may be ill-judged,  but it reflects a pre-existing dichotomy between arthouse and multiplex fare.","So have pity on the poor Academy.","If Hollywood studios weren’t quite so obsessed with superhero franchises,  the Oscars might not be in this mess in the first place."]}
