It will be possible to build friendships – and rivalries – as the story evolves,  with key decisions affecting the character arc,  while a new encounter system will provide pivotal moments that will shape each quest.","It will face competition from Harry Potter: Wizards Unite,  another mobile game from Pokémon Go developer Niantic,  also scheduled for release this year through Portkey Games. Like Pokémon Go,  Wizards Unite will use augmented reality technology to superimpose the Harry Potter universe onto the real world,  placing magical artefacts and creatures around players' neighbourhoods."]}
