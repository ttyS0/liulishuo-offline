The provocative cover story is the start of a multi-year campaign to raise awareness for reducing the prevalence of single-use plastics and the damage they cause to the environment.","Around the issue,  the U.S.,  U.K.,  and India editions of National Geographic will be shipped wrapped in paper instead of plastic,  with the goal of wrapping all global editions in paper by the end of 2019.","Beyond that,  Nat Geo is launching a scientific endeavor through the National Geographic Society to better document how plastic reaches the world's oceans and to fill critical knowledge gaps.","National Geographic Partners chief marketing officer Jill Cress says that the brand is uniquely positioned to deliver real impact through consumer education and science: \"As the most followed brand on Instagram and a global media company that reaches consumers in 172 countries,  we want to use our reach for impact and rally our audiences around solving global challenges like the plastics crisis.","\"When you combine that with the solutions that our explorers and scientists are developing,  we are a brand that is uniquely positioned to make real progress toward addressing the global plastics crisis.\""]}
