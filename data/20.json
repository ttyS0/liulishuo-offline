The state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday that Travel Frog had risen to the top of the free simulation game category in Apple's App Store in China.","In the game,  players harvest clover as currency to buy props and make a backpack for the frog before he goes on the journey. The frog will send postcards and bring back souvenirs.","Players of Travel Frog can just leave the game and log back in periodically to check whether the frog is at home or out for a trip. Perhaps that is why this game has caught on with those who seek a sense of tranquility to balance the fast-paced lives. Some see the game as a way of relieving loneliness,  in particular those who live on their own. The game also has a strong connection to child rearing. In Chinese,  the word for \"frog, \" wa,  is a homophone for a word for \"baby.\""]}
