{"title":"No, Mark Zuckerberg, weâ€™re not really in control of our data","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1524567444592-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1524567444592-4.png","contents":["The Mark Zuckerberg that showed up in a suit in Washington this week is mature. He's sweat-resistant. But he's still hiding something.","Whenever he was questioned why Facebook collects so much data,  he wheeled out: \"You have control over your information.\" But do we? That's like saying anyone can control a 747 because it has buttons and dials. Many pilots even opt for autopilot.","Facebook is hiding behind bad product design. Rather than minimizing the amount of data it collects or setting defaults that truly prioritize privacy,  Facebook presents a theater of controls and settings that few people use.","The issue is how much data Facebook is collecting about us on its own. Well beyond what we choose to post,  Facebook can track the location of your phone,  what apps you're using and even what websites you visit using its well-known \"Like\" button and an invisible tool called the Facebook Pixel. Facebook's data-mining operation can tap real-world activity such as when you use a store loyalty card. It generates biometric data from your photos.","At the end of the day,  the harsh reality for both Zuckerberg and the world is,  that Facebook's business is inseparable from its surveillance."]}
