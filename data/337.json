But more recently,  the company has hinted that it's hoping to influence society,  too.","Living Coral was chosen because it conveys a sense of optimism. \"In reaction to the onslaught of digital technology and social media increasingly embedding into daily life,  we are seeking authentic and immersive experiences that enable connection and intimacy, \" the company explained in a news release,  suggesting that the orange-pink hue would offer \"comfort and buoyancy in our continually shifting environment.‚Äù","The tropically-inspired color choice also deliberately evokes undersea coral reefs,  which are rapidly disappearing due to climate change. Speaking to Quartz,  Pressman said that the environment had been the company's \"overriding influence\" this year.","Will it solve the problems of the world? Probably not. But,  talking to the AP,  Pressman described the color as providing a sense of \"emotional nourishment.\"","\"It's a big hug, \" she said."]}
