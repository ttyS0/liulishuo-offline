UK investigates celebrities over social media promotions ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1536052826876-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1536052826876-4.jpg","contents":["Celebrities and influencers who endorse products without labeling their social media posts as paid-for by brands were warned in early August that they were breaking the rules as Britain's regulator launched an investigation into the trend.","Recommendation from celebrities and social media influencers who have millions of followers is a growing marketing strategy for brands,  but the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that such endorsements could mislead customers.","\"If people see clothes,  cosmetics,  a car,  or a holiday being plugged by someone they admire,  they might be swayed into buying it, \" said George Lusty,  the CMA's Senior Director for Consumer Protection.","\"So it's really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves,  or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand.\"","Brands will pay anywhere from $10, 000 to more than $100, 000 for a single social media post,  depending on the size,  engagement and loyalty of the person's followers,  and Unilever said it accounted for \"tens of millions\" of its 7.7-billion-euro marketing last year.","The most famous can earn even more. Reality TV stars Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian,  singer Selena Gomez and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo are the top-paid celebrities per post on Instagram,  earning up to 1 million dollars a post,  according to social media analytics firm HopperHQ."]}
