And \"Three Billboards, \" which also won the Golden Globe for best drama,  would appear to have seized the pole position.","Several other movies likely to receive an Oscar award when they're unveiled come with their own handicaps. \"Get Out\" and \"The Shape of Water, \" for example,  both have a foot in the horror genre,  which is not historically one that academy voters have favored.","The Oscar nominations will only settle the guessing games about who is likely to win on March 4,  and as the Hollywood Reporter noted,  \"there's still a lot of time for the winds to change.\""]}
