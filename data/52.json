The world's biggest soft drinks company said it would start making a version of “Chu-Hi” – canned sparkling flavored drinks that include a local spirit called shochu.","frames":[3980,22620],"images":[]},{"text":"Sales of the drink,  which ranges in alcohol content from 3-8%,  have surged over the past five years and it is particularly popular with female drinkers. Coca-Cola's Japan president said: \"We haven't experimented in the low-alcohol category before,  but it's an example of how we continue to explore opportunities outside our core areas.\" He also said Coca-Cola would probably sell its alcoholic drinks only in Japan,  because of the \"unique and special qualities\" of the domestic market.","frames":[23140,55640],"images":[]},{"text":"Howard Telford,  head of soft drinks at Euromonitor International,  a market research firm,  said: \"The Chu-Hi category is found almost exclusively in Japan. Globally,  it's not uncommon for non-alcoholic beverages to be sold in the same system as alcoholic beverages. It makes sense to give this a try in our market.\"","frames":[56060,76840],"images":[]}],"shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1521788496250-rc-upload-1521787403599-26.png","id":52}
