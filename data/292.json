Braun later claimed that he didn't write the tweet and deleted it,  but \"Chinese bots\" nonetheless became a trending topic,  and Grande not-so-discreetly fanned the flames by hitting \"like\" on a tweet that accused Wu of cheating.","On the Chinese Internet,  the episode has become one of the most hotly debated subjects,  not just because legions of Wu's fans have sprung to his defense,  but also because the fraud allegations appeared to touch a nerve in a country where faked box office receipts,  faked e-commerce reviews and faked download numbers are recognized as tricks from an all-too-familiar playbook.","Hong Kong hip-hop artist Edison Chen chimed in in English: \"Money can't buy u love,  money can't buy u fame,  money can't buy u charts.\"","Grande returned to the top of the U.S. iTunes chart on Wednesday with a seemingly fitting single she had debuted live on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\"","The title?","\"Thank U,  Next.\""]}
