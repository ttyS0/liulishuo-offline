{"title":"MI6 advert seeks to ditch 'mythical' James Bond image ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1528275750554-321.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1528275750554-319.jpg","contents":["The advert's opening shot could be straight from a James Bond movie. Sinister music plays as a shark circles. Seconds later,  the scene widens to show a startled child being comforted by his mother in an aquarium.","But the message MI6 wants to convey is how the spy agency is less interested in recruiting would-be 007s than people who reflect the diversity of the UK – mothers,  for example.","“We are intelligence officers,  but we don't do what you think, ” the ad's voiceover says. “It is not keeping your cool in the shark tank. It is picking up the silent cues that matter.” Then comes the payoff: “MI6 – secretly,  we are just like you.”","MI6 is looking to take on an extra 800 people by 2021. Figures for 2016 show that the agency has a serious gender imbalance,  with women making up 38% of non-senior staff and occupying just a quarter of senior posts. Just under 7% of non-senior staff are from a black,  Asian or minority ethnic background and these groups are not represented at all in the senior ranks.","The security service's chief,  Alex Younger,  who wants greater diversity to be one of his legacies,  has previously said that James Bond is a blessing and a curse for MI6: though the action film franchise offers priceless free publicity,  it gives a misleading picture of life as an officer."]}
