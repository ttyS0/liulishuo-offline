{"title":"Super 80: The Man of Steel’s upcoming birthday offers a gift to fans","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/1520615764591-rc-upload-1520613801471-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/1520615750913-rc-upload-1520613801471-4.png","contents":["On April 18,  1938,  action comics No. 1 hit newsstands,  and the world was introduced to Superman. Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster—two young guys out of Cleveland—the character was so primal,  so evocative,  so revolutionary that he instantly connected with readers (kids and adults alike),  altered the fortunes of the lowly comic book and birthed a new concept: the superhero.","Eighty years later,  and Action Comics is still making history: The 1, 000th issue will hit stands on April 18. To coincide with that milestone,  its publisher,  DC,  will release a hardcover book,  Action Comics #1000: 80 Years of Superman. The story's inclusion is a belated tribute to the duo behind what has become a seminal work. \"In all of the history of literature,  there are only five fictional characters known to every man,  woman and child on the planet, \" science fiction author Harlan Ellison wrote in 1988. \"Mickey Mouse,  Sherlock Holmes,  Tarzan,  Robin Hood…and Superman.\"","Eight decades after Action Comics No. 1 leapt off newsstands,  our relationship with Superman has gotten complex. In an ironic age,  Kal-El's earnestness can seem stodgy: He's not dark enough. He's unnecessary. Even worse,  he's boring. Wrong,  all of it. Just ask the kid who finds confidence by tying a red towel around his neck. Or the immigrant who sees a kindred spirit in the refugee who escaped the dying planet Krypton. Or the soldier who finds a bulletproof mascot in the Man of Steel. \"Superman is us, \" author Ray Bradbury wrote in 1987,  \"and we are Superman.\" Thirty years later,  that's still true."]}
