It runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character,  played by Korean star Song Kang-ho."},{"frames":[22240,59440],"images":[],"text":"Song Kang-ho plays Ki-taek,  a shiftless,  unemployed man who lives in a chaotic,  stinky and squalid basement with his wife,  Chung-sook,  his smart yet cynical twentysomething daughter,  Ki-jung,  and son,  Ki-woo. They are all out of work and out of cash. Then Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune: an old school-friend helps him get a lucrative tutoring job. With a fake college diploma created by Ki-jung,  he shows up at the fabulously lavish home of the Park family."},{"frames":[59440,85360],"images":[],"text":"Likable Ki-woo is an instant hit with his new employers. Then the distrait lady of the house,  Yeon-kyo,  reveals that she also needs an art tutor for her young son,  to mould his painting talents; Ki-woo suggests his sister (while concealing their relationship),  and soon the brazen Ki-jung is also a success with these rich suckers."},{"frames":[85360,108640],"images":[],"text":"The poorer family see themselves in a distorting mirror that cruelly reveals to them how wretched they are by contrast and reveals the riches that could — and should — be theirs. It is almost a supernatural or sci-fi story; an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers. Parasite gets its tendrils into you."},{"frames":[108640,110640],"images":[],"text":""}]}
