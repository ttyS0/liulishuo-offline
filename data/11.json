American social-media users can now find out whether they resemble famous artworks by taking selfies using Google's Arts & Culture app. A new feature uses facial-recognition software to match photos with paintings and sculptures from museums around the world.","Celebrities take to Instagram to share their art twins. Google estimates that 30m selfies have been uploaded to what became last weekend's most downloaded app. Not everyone is pleased.","Google issued a statement clarifying that the pictures were used only for art matches,  after privacy concerns were raised. It blocked the selfie tool in Texas and Illinois,  where state laws prohibit the collection of biometric data. And when infuriated Brits discovered that the feature is available only to Americans,  they bombarded the app with one-star ratings."]}
