{"title":"Marie Kondo's Netflix series inspires a national decluttering frenzy","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1548483182804-18.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1548483182804-16.jpg","contents":["On New Yearâ€™s Day,  Netflix released \"Tidying Up With Marie Kondo, \" an eight-part series hosted by the Japanese-born decluttering diva and space healer. Although resolving to clean up stuff is a typical New Year's resolution,  there is rarely something as motivating to kick-start the process as a reality makeover show.","The show seems to have started a national conversation about overbuying and over-stashing. Many opened junk drawers and toy chests while watching the show and started dumping. Shoe boxes were repurposed as drawer organizers,  and T-shirts were folded in the crisp KonMari style. (Reminder: The KonMari Method,  as it is called,  asks you to hold each possession and ask yourself whether it sparks joy,  and if it doesn't,  thank it for its service and let it go.)","Kondo,  34,  started out as an organizing consultant while a university student in Tokyo. Her 2011 book \"The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\" put her on the clutter-busting map. Today,  more than 11 million copies of her three books have been sold worldwide.","Although Netflix won't share any viewership data,  this show clearly hit a nerve.","Current Boutique owner Carmen Lopez says mail-in consignments to its four Washington,  D.C.,  area locations have increased 25 percent since the show aired. \"The show has definitely inspired some serious purging, \" Lopez says.","Kondo's office issued a statement from her about the response to the Netflix show. \"It's my sincere hope that the items at the donation centers will find new owners for whom they will truly spark joy.\""]}
