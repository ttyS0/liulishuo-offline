{"title":"The new Canon: the best films of the 2000s","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1535365913327-6.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1535365913327-4.jpg","contents":["This list advances the modest proposal that,  when it comes to the Canon,  we expand our notions of permanence and connoisseurship to include films that are worthy of appreciation—even veneration—despite being so recent. (As for rankings,  this collection is unnumbered,  reflecting a loose,  intuitive collection rather than a strict hierarchy.) No one is a prophet in their own hometown; sometimes we need reminding that many of the films we're seeing right now are genuinely timeless.","\"Spirited Away\" (2001) Japanese anime director Hayao Miyazaki seems unable to make anything but masterpieces; still,  this epic tale of a young girl separated from her parents and thrust into a magical world stands as his greatest—not only for its transporting visuals but also for its bracing sense of adventure,  terror,  resilience and heroism. Full of whimsy,  fantasy and childlike wonder—elements that would otherwise feel overbearing or unforgivably ersatz—Miyazaki's vision is also earthy and profound,  even at its most allegorical."]}
