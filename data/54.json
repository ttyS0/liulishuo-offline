For Sherlock star Martin Freeman,  who played Dr Watson in the series,  having an army of rabid devotees isn't always as great as it seems.","Hopes of a fifth season of the beloved BBC show are fading by the day. According to Freeman,  part of the long post-Season 4 delay was due to viewers' expectations running wild. In a new interview with The Telegraph,   he has revealed that fans loved the show to death,  saying  it was \"kind of impossible\" to live up to the fans' expectations.","Above all,  Freeman said,  it was about going too big too fast. The popularity of Sherlock's first season spanned an entire ocean at lightning speed,  and keeping that kind of quality up while also keeping fans entertained while also doing it in three 90-minute episodes that only arrived every few years was an impossible task. \"Sherlock was notably high quality from the outset, \" he admits. \"And when you start [that high] it's pretty hard to maintain that.\""]}
