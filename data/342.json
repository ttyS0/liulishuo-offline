{"title":"What happened at Theranos is a dazzling story of deception ","audio":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1546571598281-32.mp3","poster":"https://cc-ali.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1546571598281-30.jpg","contents":["It is quite a tale John Carreyrou tells in his book,  \"Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup.\" It is a story of jaw-dropping lying and greed so immense that billions of dollars fly by with every turn of the page.","The subject is Theranos,  the start-up that promised to revolutionize blood testing. Still,  the real subject is Elizabeth Holmes,  who started the company as a 19-year-old Stanford University dropout—and who wore black turtlenecks in blatant imitation of Steve Jobs. She handled her elders the way a snake charmer handles snakes. Only in her case,  she was the one with poison.","Her genius,  Carreyrou says,  was lying. She had come up with a blood test that could be taken with a teeny-weeny drop or two of blood from the finger. No pain,  much gain. No more searching for a vein.","Holmes knew little about the technology,  but she employed people who did.  And,  as Carreyrou writes,  when these employees suspected the device was not working - the results were being faked and the lives of patients were put at risk—they were fired,  often escorted off the premises that very day by security personnel.","Some board members and investors wondered about the excessive security. All were dissuaded or pacified by Holmes,  a zealot who apparently believed so fervently in her vision that truth was just a matter of time. This is a Silicon Valley failing,  which is why billions get invested on the promise of billions more being made—fake it till you make it,  as the saying goes."]}
