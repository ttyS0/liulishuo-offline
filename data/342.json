{"content":[{"images":[],"text":"It is quite a tale John Carreyrou tells in his book,  \"Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup.\" It is a story of jaw-dropping lying and greed so immense that billions of dollars fly by with every turn of the page.","frames":[4820,21640]},{"images":[],"text":"The subject is Theranos,  the start-up that promised to revolutionize blood testing. Still,  the real subject is Elizabeth Holmes,  who started the company as a 19-year-old Stanford University dropout—and who wore black turtlenecks in blatant imitation of Steve Jobs. She handled her elders the way a snake charmer handles snakes. Only in her case,  she was the one with poison.","frames":[21640,47880]},{"images":[],"text":"Her genius,  Carreyrou says,  was lying. She had come up with a blood test that could be taken with a teeny-weeny drop or two of blood from the finger. No pain,  much gain. No more searching for a vein.","frames":[47880,61290]},{"images":[],"text":"Holmes knew little about the technology,  but she employed people who did.  And,  as Carreyrou writes,  when these employees suspected the device was not working - the results were being faked and the lives of patients were put at risk—they were fired,  often escorted off the premises that very day by security personnel.","frames":[61290,83290]},{"images":[],"text":"Some board members and investors wondered about the excessive security. All were dissuaded or pacified by Holmes,  a zealot who apparently believed so fervently in her vision that truth was just a matter of time. This is a Silicon Valley failing,  which is why billions get invested on the promise of billions more being made—fake it till you make it,  as the saying goes.","frames":[83290,108470]},{"images":[],"text":"","frames":[108470,113470]}],"author":"1.6 Bad blood Daniel","shareImgUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1546570276208-38.jpg","id":342,"posterUrl":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/image/rc-upload-1546571598281-30.jpg","duration":108696,"url":"https://cdn.llscdn.com/fe-static/vira/audio/rc-upload-1546571598281-32.mp3","engTitle":"What happened at Theranos is a dazzling story of deception ","title":"血检公司 Theranos 就是一个精彩的骗局 "}
