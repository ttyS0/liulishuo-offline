Just a few days ago it was announced that the platform reached 1 billion monthly active users this Chinese New Year holiday,  making it the largest social network on the planet not owned by Mark Zuckerberg.","Chinese users spend approximately one third of all their time on the phone in WeChat. That was a huge opportunity to build extra features and functionality on top of the basic messaging experience.","And it was many of these features that hit the China market at exactly the right time,  met the needs of local users perfectly,  and helped propel WeChat to becoming the juggernaut that it is today.","The growth rate of new active WeChat users has been steadily declining and many believe it has pretty much reached a ceiling. The future and focus of WeChat will not be about gaining more new users,  it will be about embracing the vision to \"Connect people to people,  people to services and people to businesses.\""]}
